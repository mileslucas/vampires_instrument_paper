	abstract = {Debris disks are tenuous, dust-dominated disks commonly observed around stars over a wide range of ages. Those around main sequence stars are analogous to the Solar System's Kuiper Belt and zodiacal light. The dust in debris disks is believed to be continuously regenerated, originating primarily with collisions of planetesimals. Observations of debris disks provide insight into the evolution of planetary systems; and the composition of dust, comets, and planetesimals outside the Solar System; as well as placing constraints on the orbital architecture and potentially the masses of exoplanets that are not otherwise detectable. This review highlights recent advances in multiwavelength, high-resolution scattered light and thermal imaging that have revealed a complex and intricate diversity of structures in debris disks and discusses how modeling methods are evolving with the breadth and depth of the available observations. Two rapidly advancing subfields highlighted in this review include observations of atomic and molecular gas around main sequence stars and variations in emission from debris disks on very short (days to years) timescales, providing evidence of non-steady-state collisional evolution particularly in young debris disks.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Polarimetric imaging is one of the most effective techniques for high-contrast imaging and for the characterization of protoplanetary disks, and it has the potential of becoming instrumental in the characterization of exoplanets. The Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE) instrument installed on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) contains the InfraRed Dual-band Imager and Spectrograph (IRDIS) with a dual-beam polarimetric imaging (DPI) mode, which offers the capability of obtaining linear polarization images at high contrast and resolution.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We aim to provide an overview of the polarimetric imaging mode of VLT/SPHERE/IRDIS and study its optical design to improve observing strategies and data reduction.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} For {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band observations of TW Hydrae, we compared two data reduction methods that correct for instrumental polarization effects in different ways: a minimization of the “noise” image ({\textless}i{\textgreater}U{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}ϕ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}), and a correction method based on a polarimetric model that we have developed, as presented in Paper II of this study.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We use observations of TW Hydrae to illustrate the data reduction. In the images of the protoplanetary disk around this star, we detect variability in the polarized intensity and angle of linear polarization that depend on the pointing-dependent instrument configuration. We explain these variations as instrumental polarization effects and correct for these effects using our model-based correction method.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The polarimetric imaging mode of IRDIS has proven to be a very successful and productive high-contrast polarimetric imaging system. However, the instrument performance is strongly dependent on the specific instrument configuration. We suggest adjustments to future observing strategies to optimize polarimetric efficiency in field-tracking mode by avoiding unfavorable derotator angles. We recommend reducing on-sky data with the pipeline called IRDAP, which includes the model-based correction method (described in Paper II) to optimally account for the remaining telescope and instrumental polarization effects and to retrieve the true polarization state of the incident light.},

	abstract = {Barium (Ba) dwarfs and CH subgiants are the less evolved analogues of Ba and CH giants. They are F- to G-type main-sequence stars polluted with heavy elements by their binary companions when the companion was on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). This companion is now a white dwarf that in most cases cannot be directly detected. We present a large systematic study of 60 objects classified as Ba dwarfs or CH subgiants. Combining radial-velocity measurements from HERMES and SALT high-resolution spectra with radial-velocity data from CORAVEL and CORALIE, we determine the orbital parameters of 27 systems. We also derive their masses by comparing their location in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram with evolutionary models. We confirm that Ba dwarfs and CH subgiants are not at different evolutionary stages, and that they have similar metallicities, despite their different names. Additionally, Ba giants appear significantly more massive than their main-sequence analogues. This is likely due to observational biases against the detection of hotter main-sequence post-mass-transfer objects. Combining our spectroscopic orbits with the HIPPARCOS astrometric data, we derive the orbital inclination and the mass of the WD companion for four systems. Since this cannot be done for all systems in our sample yet (but should be possible with upcoming {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data releases), we also analyse the mass-function distribution of our binaries. We can model this distribution with very narrow mass distributions for the two components and random orbital orientations on the sky. Finally, based on BINSTAR evolutionary models, we suggest that the orbital evolution of low-mass Ba systems can be affected by a second phase of interactions along the red giant branch of the Ba star, which impact the eccentricities and periods of the giants.},

Polarization rotators utilizing tunable birefringent plates, such as liquid crystal (LC) devices, have the advantage of non-mechanically tuning the devices' retardance. However, these devices properly work with incident light within a very specific wavelength range. Ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) devices can switch between two orthogonal states of linear polarization, and offer response times much faster than their nematic liquid crystal cell counterparts. An achromatic polarization rotator can be constructed with an FLC cell between two half-wave plates that have been constructed to produce a half-wave retardance at a certain design wavelength. This results in a device that offers fast response times and high polarization purity over a broader wavelength range.},

	abstract = {The Visible Aperture Masking Polarimetric Imager for Resolved Exoplanetary Structures (VAMPIRES) is a visible light instrument on the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) system. To characterize the Instrumental Polarization (IP) and crosstalk of the system, measurements with a polarized internal calibration source were taken to provide diattenuation and retardance estimates of components downstream of the telescope mirrors. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations, we developed a Mueller matrix model of VAMPIRES in five wavelength bands. The process of deriving the model revealed degeneracies involving multiple possible sets of values for highly correlated instrument parameters. It also revealed a significant difference in the EM gain ratio between VAMPIRES’ two cameras and the highly non-ideal behavior of the Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal (FLC). Observations of unpolarized and polarized standard stars from two separate nights have been collected and are currently being analyzed to provide an estimate of M3’s diattenuation and retardance as well, and the polarized standard stars in particular will be used as a final metric to quantify the instrument model’s accuracy. The current Mueller matrix model has already been applied to preliminary data analysis for the circumstellar disk HD34700 and has helped confirm that an observed 17\&deg; phase shift in differential visibilities for Mu Cephei is astrophysical in nature. The non-ideal behaviour of certain components highlights the need for a standard calibration procedure that should be performed regularly to track changes in VAMPIRES’ polarization qualities. Our laboratory and on-sky data collection and analysis procedures will be refined to be re-used to calibrate future versions of VAMPIRES, including its most recent upgrade in 2023.},

	abstract = {SCExAO at the Subaru telescope is a visible and near-infrared high-contrast imaging instrument employing extreme adaptive optics and coronagraphy. The instrument feeds the near-infrared light (JHK) to the integral-field spectrograph CHARIS. The spectropolarimetric capability of CHARIS is enabled by a Wollaston prism and is unique among high-contrast imagers. We present a detailed Mueller matrix model describing the instrumental polarization effects of the complete optical path, thus the telescope and instrument. From measurements with the internal light source, we find that the image derotator (K-mirror) produces strongly wavelength-dependent crosstalk, in the worst case converting {\textasciitilde}95\% of the incident linear polarization to circularly polarized light that cannot be measured. Observations of an unpolarized star show that the magnitude of the instrumental polarization of the telescope varies with wavelength between 0.5\% and 1\%, and that its angle is exactly equal to the altitude angle of the telescope. Using physical models of the fold mirror of the telescope, the half-wave plate, and the derotator, we simultaneously fit the instrumental polarization effects in the 22 wavelength bins. Over the full wavelength range, our model currently reaches a total polarimetric accuracy between 0.08\% and 0.24\% in the degree of linear polarization. We propose additional calibration measurements to improve the polarimetric accuracy to {\textless}0.1\% and plan to integrate the complete Mueller matrix model into the existing CHARIS post-processing pipeline. Our calibrations of CHARIS' spectropolarimetric mode will enable unique quantitative polarimetric studies of circumstellar disks and planetary and brown dwarf companions.},

	abstract = {Electron multiplying charge-coupled devices (EMCCDs) are a variant of standard CCD technology capable of single-optical photon counting at MHz pixel readout rates. For photon counting, thermal dark signal and clock-induced charge (CIC) are the dominant source of noise and must be minimized to reduce the likelihood of coincident events. Thermal dark signal is reduced to low levels through cooling or operation in inverted mode (pinning). However, mitigation of CIC requires precise tuning of both parallel and serial clock waveforms. Here, we present a detailed study of CIC within Teledyne-e2v EMCCDs with a goal of better understanding the physical mechanisms that dominate CIC production in both noninverted and inverted mode operations (IMO). Measurements are presented as a function of parallel and serial clock timings, clock amplitudes, and device temperature. The effects of radiation damage and annealing are also discussed. A widely accepted view is that CIC is signal generated through impact ionization of energetic holes as the clock phase is driven high. While this explanation holds for IMO, we propose that the majority of CIC generated in noninverted mode is in fact due to a secondary effect of light emission from hot carriers. The information from this study is then used to optimize CIC on Teledyne e2v CCD201s operating at 1-MHz pixel rate in NIMO. For the CCD201, we obtained total CIC levels as low as 6.9 × 10 − 4 e − / pix / frame with ≥90 \% detective quantum efficiency. We conclude with proposals to further reduce CIC based upon modifications to clocking schemes and device architecture.},

We have analyzed SPHERE/ZIMPOL point spread functions (PSFs) and measure the normalized peak surface brightness, the encircled energy, and the full width half maximum (FWHM) for different wavelengths, atmospheric conditions, star brightness, and instrument modes. Coronagraphic images are described and the peak flux attenuation and the off-axis flux transmission are determined. Simultaneous images of the coronagraphic focal plane and the pupil plane are analyzed and the suppression of the diffraction rings by the pupil stop is investigated. We compared the performance at small separation for different coronagraphs with tests for the binary {\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Hyi with a separation of 92 mas and a contrast of Δ{\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≈ 6{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. For the polarimetric mode we made the instrument calibrations using zero polarization and high polarization standard stars and here we give a recipe for the absolute calibration of polarimetric data. The data show small ({\textless} 1 mas) but disturbing differential polarimetric beam shifts, which can be explained as Goos-Hähnchen shifts from the inclined mirrors, and we discuss how to correct this effect.

Coronagraphic observations in 8 filters spanning from 1.8 to 23{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mu\$m provide an unprecedentedly clear view of the disk at these wavelengths. The objectives of the observing program were to investigate the dust composition and distribution, and to investigate the presence of planets in the system. In this paper, we focus on the disk components, providing surface brightness measurements for all images and a detailed investigation of the asymmetries observed. A companion paper by Kammerer et al. will focus on the planets in this system using the same data. We report for the first time the presence of an extended secondary disk in thermal emission, with a curved extension bent away from the plane of the disk. This feature, which we refer to as the ``cat's tail", seems to be connected with the previously reported CO clump, mid-infrared asymmetry detected in the southwest side, and the warp observed in scattered light. We present a model of this secondary disk sporadically producing dust that broadly reproduces the morphology, flux, and color of the cat's tail, as well as other features observed in the disk, and suggests the secondary disk is composed largely of porous, organic refractory dust grains.},

	abstract = {Proxima b is a rocky exoplanet in the habitable zone of the nearest star system and a key test case in the search for extraterrestrial life. Here, we investigate the characterization of a potential Earth-like atmosphere around Proxima b in reflected light via molecule mapping, combining high resolution spectroscopy (HRS) and high contrast imaging, using the first-generation integral field spectrograph HARMONI on the \$39\$-m Extremely Large Telescope. We simulate comprehensive observations of Proxima b at an assumed \$45{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ inclination using HARMONI's High Contrast Adaptive Optics mode, with spatial resolution \${\textbackslash}sim 8\$mas (\$3.88\$mas/spaxel) and spectral resolving power \$R{\textbackslash}simeq17,000\$ between \$1.538\$--\$1.678 {\textbackslash}mu m\$, containing the spectral features of water, carbon dioxide and methane. Tellurics, stellar features, and additional noise sources are included, and removed using established molecule mapping techniques. We find that HARMONI's current focal plane mask (FPM) is too large and obscures the orbit of Proxima b and thus explore smaller and offset FPMs to yield a detection. A \${\textbackslash}rm\{S/N\}=5\$ detection of Proxima b's reflected light, suitable for atmospheric characterisation, is possible with such modifications, requiring a minimum of \$20\$ hours, but ideally at least \$30\$ hours of integration time. We highlight that such detections do not scale with the photon noise, hence suitably detailed simulations of future instruments for the ELTs are needed to fully understand their ability to perform HRS observations of exoplanet atmospheres. Alterations to the HARMONI FPM design are feasible at this stage, but must be considered in context of other science cases.},

	abstract = {Fluxes are presented for 103 stars which were observed for Hubble Space Telescope (HST) calibration. Perhaps the most important aspect of this work is confirmation of a revised zero point for optical flux calibration of HST as described by Colina and Bohlin from synthetic photometry. Two cautions are offered for users of the Oke and Gunn spectrophotometric system, and simple corrections are suggested. The present stars are of interest because of their accessibility and their importance in a variety of standard systems. Included are UV and optical spectrophotometric flux standards, UBVRI and IR photometric standards, and many stars from the Equatorial Selected Areas for which UBVRI colors exist as well. It is hoped that the present data will be of use to those relating results between systems. The spectra generally cover the range λλ4040-8800, with a nominal resolution of about 5.5 Å pixel-1. The data are referred to the absolute calibration of α Lyrae recommended by Mégessier. Tabular magnitude values for Hayes and Oke-Guim wavelengths are presented. The same tables as well as mean magnitudes within 25 Å bins every 25 Å in ASCII and PostScript format, and flux-calibrated spectra, may be obtained from the author.},

	abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (330-680 nm) and G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}RP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

	abstract = {Aims: RefPlanets is a guaranteed time observation programme that uses the Zurich IMaging POLarimeter (ZIMPOL) of Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch instrument at the Very Large Telescope to perform a blind search for exoplanets in wavelengths from 600 to 900 nm. The goals of this study are the characterisation of the unprecedented high polarimetic contrast and polarimetric precision capabilities of ZIMPOL for bright targets, the search for polarised reflected light around some of the closest bright stars to the Sun, and potentially the direct detection of an evolved cold exoplanet for the first time. Methods: For our observations of α Cen A and B, Sirius A, Altair, ɛ Eri and τ Ceti we used the polarimetricdifferential imaging (PDI) mode of ZIMPOL which removes the speckle noise down to the photon noise limit for angular separations ≿0.6''. We describe some of the instrumental effects that dominate the noise for smaller separations and explain how to remove these additional noise effects in post-processing. We then combine PDI with angular differential imaging as a final layer of post-processing to further improve the contrast limits of our data at these separations. Results: For good observing conditions we achieve polarimetric contrast limits of 15.0-16.3 mag at the effective inner working angle of {\textasciitilde}0.13'', 16.3-18.3 mag at 0.5'', and 18.8-20.4 mag at 1.5''. The contrast limits closer in (≾0.6'') display a significant dependence on observing conditions, while in the photon-noise-dominated regime (≿0.6'') the limits mainly depend on the brightness of the star and the total integration time. We compare our results with contrast limits from other surveys and review the exoplanet detection limits obtained with different detection methods.

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Distinguishing the signal from young gas-rich circumstellar disks from the stellar signal in near-infrared (NIR) light is a difficult task. Multiple techniques have been developed over the years of which angular differential imaging (ADI) and polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) have been most successful. However, both techniques cope with drawbacks such as self-subtraction. To address these drawbacks, we explore iterative ADI (IADI) techniques to increase signal throughput in total intensity observations.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The aim of this work is to explore the effectiveness of IADI in recovering the self-subtracted regions of disks by applying ADI techniques iteratively.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} IADI works by feeding back all positive signal of the result from standard ADI over multiple iterations. To determine the effectiveness of IADI, a model of a disk image is made and post-processed with IADI. We explored two versions of IADI, classical IADI, which uses the median of the data set to reconstruct the point spread function (PSF), and PCA-IADI, which uses principal component analysis to model the PSF. In addition, we explored masking based on polarimetric images and a signal threshold for feeding back signal.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Asymmetries are a very important factor in recovering the disk because these lead to less overlap of the disk in the data set. In some cases, we were able to recover a factor {\textasciitilde}75 more flux with IADI than with ADI. The Procrustes distance is used to quantify the impact of the algorithm on the scattering phase function. Depending on the level of noise and the ratio between the stellar signal and disk signal, the phase function can be recovered a factor 6.4 in Procrustes distance better than standard ADI. Amplification and smearing of noise over the image due to many iterations did occur. By using binary masks and a dynamic threshold this feedback was mitigated, but it is still a problem in the final pipeline. Finally, observations of protoplanetary disks made with VLT/SPHERE were processed with IADI giving rise to very promising results.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} While IADI has problems with low-signal-to-noise-ratio (S/N) observations due to noise amplification and star reconstruction, higher S/N observations show promising results with respect to standard ADI.},

	abstract = {Astronomical images often have regions with missing or unwanted information, such as bad pixels, bad columns, cosmic rays, masked objects, or residuals from imperfect model subtractions. In certain situations it can be essential, or preferable, to fill in these regions. Most existing methods use low order interpolations for this task. In this paper a method is described that uses the full information that is contained in the pixels just outside masked regions. These edge pixels are extrapolated inwards, using iterative median filtering. This leads to a smoothly varying spatial resolution within the filled-in regions, and ensures seamless transitions between masked pixels and good pixels. Gaps in continuous, narrow features can be reconstructed with high fidelity, even if they are large. The method is implemented in maskfill, an open-source MIT licensed Python script. Its performance is illustrated with several examples.},

FITS was adopted by astronomers in the early 1980s to overcome incompatibilities between operating systems. On the back of FITS’ success, astronomical data became both backward compatible and easily shareable. However, new advances in the astronomical instrumentation, computational technologies, and analytic techniques have resulted in new data that do not work well within the traditional FITS format. Tensions have arisen between the desire to update the format to meet new analytic challenges and adherence to the original edict for the FITS file format to be backward compatible. We examine three inflection points in the governance of FITS: first, initial development and success, second, widespread acceptance and governance by the working group, and third, the challenges to FITS in a new era of increasing data and computational complexity within astronomy.},

We propose an automated approach for the classification of stellar spectra in the optical region using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Traditional machine learning (ML) methods with 'shallow' architecture (usually up to two hidden layers) have been trained for these purposes in the past. However, deep learning methods with a larger number of hidden layers allow the use of finer details in the spectrum which results in improved accuracy and better generalization. Studying finer spectral signatures also enables us to determine accurate differential stellar parameters and find rare objects. We examine various machine and deep learning algorithms like artificial neural networks, Random Forest, and CNN to classify stellar spectra using the Jacoby Atlas, ELODIE, and MILES spectral libraries as training samples. We test the performance of the trained networks on the Indo-U.S. Library of Coudé Feed Stellar Spectra (CFLIB). We show that using CNNs, we are able to lower the error up to 1.23 spectral subclasses as compared to that of two subclasses achieved in the past studies with ML approach. We further apply the trained model to classify stellar spectra retrieved from the SDSS data base with SNR {\textgreater} 20.},

	abstract = {The fourth United States Naval Observatory (USNO) CCD Astrograph Catalog, UCAC4, was released in 2012 August (double-sided DVD and CDS data center Vizier catalog I/322). It is the final release in this series and contains over 113 million objects; over 105 million of them with proper motions (PMs). UCAC4 is an updated version of UCAC3 with about the same number of stars also covering all-sky. Bugs were fixed, Schmidt plate survey data were avoided, and precise five-band photometry was added for about half the stars. Astrograph observations have been supplemented for bright stars by FK6, Hipparcos, and Tycho-2 data to compile a UCAC4 star catalog complete from the brightest stars to about magnitude R = 16. Epoch 1998-2004 positions are obtained from observations with the 20 cm aperture USNO Astrograph's "red lens," equipped with a 4k by 4k CCD. Mean positions and PMs are derived by combining these observations with over 140 ground- and space-based catalogs, including Hipparcos/Tycho and the AC2000.2, as well as unpublished measures of over 5000 plates from other astrographs. For most of the faint stars in the southern hemisphere, the first epoch plates from the Southern Proper Motion program form the basis for PMs, while the Northern Proper Motion first epoch plates serve the same purpose for the rest of the sky. These data are supplemented by 2MASS near-IR photometry for about 110 million stars and five-band (B, V, g, r, i) APASS data for over 51 million stars. Thus the published UCAC4, as were UCAC3 and UCAC2, is a compiled catalog with the UCAC observational program being a major component. The positional accuracy of stars in UCAC4 at mean epoch is about 15-100 mas per coordinate, depending on magnitude, while the formal errors in PMs range from about 1 to 10 mas yr-1 depending on magnitude and observing history. Systematic errors in PMs are estimated to be about 1-4 mas yr-1.},

We analyze imaging data and corresponding adaptive optics telemetry, observing conditions, and other metadata over a three-year time period to characterize the performance of the instrument and predict the detection limits of future observations. We systematically process images from 359 observations of 304 unique stars to subtract residual starlight (i.e., the coronagraphic point-spread function) of the target star using two methods: angular differential imaging (ADI) and reference star differential imaging (RDI). We find that for the typical parallactic angle (PA) rotation of our data set (∼10°), RDI provides gains over ADI for angular separations smaller than 0.″25. Furthermore, we find a power-law relation between the angular separation from the host star and the minimum PA rotation required for ADI to outperform RDI, with a power-law index of −1.18 ± 0.08. Finally, we use random forest models to estimate ADI and RDI post-processed detection limits a priori. These models, which we provide publicly on a website, explain 70\%–80\% of the variance in ADI detection limits and 30\%–50\% of the variance in RDI detection limits. Averaged over a range of angular separations, our models predict both ADI and RDI contrast to within a factor of 2. These results illuminate important factors in high-contrast imaging observations with the NIRC2 vortex coronagraph, help improve observing strategies, and inform future upgrades to the hardware.},

Because the coronagraph blocks most of the light from the star, it prevents the properties of the host star from being measured directly. Instead, satellite spots, which are created by diffraction from a square grid in the pupil plane, can be used to locate the star and extract its spectrum. We describe the techniques implemented into the GPI Data Reduction Pipeline to measure the properties of the satellite spots and discuss the precision of the reconstructed astrometry and spectrophotometry of the occulted star. We find the astrometric precision of the satellite spots in an \$H\$-band datacube to be \$0.05\$ pixels and is best when individual satellite spots have a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of \${\textgreater} 20\$. In regards to satellite spot spectrophotometry, we find that the total flux from the satellite spots is stable to \${\textbackslash}sim 7{\textbackslash}\%\$ and scales linearly with central star brightness and that the shape of the satellite spot spectrum varies on the \$2{\textbackslash}\%\$ level.},

	abstract = {Astronomical data reduction is usually done with processing pipelines that consist of a series of individual processing steps that can be executed stand-alone. These processing steps are then strung together into workflows and fed with data to address a particular processing goal. In this paper, we propose a data processing system that automatically derives processing workflows for different use cases from a single specification of a cascade of processing steps. The system works by using formalized descriptions of data processing pipelines that specify the input and output of each processing step. Inputs can be existing data or the output of a previous step. Rules to select the most appropriate input data are directly attached to the description. A version of the proposed system has been implemented as the ESO Data Processing System (EDPS) in the Python language. The specification of processing cascades and data organisation rules use a restrictive set of Python classes, attributes and functions. The EDPS implementation of the proposed system was used to demonstrate that it is possible to automatically derive from a single specification of a pipeline processing cascade the workflows that the European Southern Observatory uses for quality control, archive production, and specialized science reduction. The EDPS will be used to replace all data reduction systems using different workflow specifications that are currently used at the European Southern Observatory.},

We present an adaptive optics observing method, called star-hopping, recently offered as standard queue observing (service mode) for the SPHERE instrument at the VLT. The method uses reference difference imaging (RDI) but, unlike earlier RDI applications, images of a reference star for PSF subtraction are obtained within minutes of observing the target star.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We aim to significantly gain in contrast beyond the conventional angular differencing imaging (ADI) method to search for a fifth planet at separations less than 10 au, interior to the four giant planets of the HR 8799 system. The most likely semimajor axes allowed for this hypothetical planet, which were estimated via dynamical simulations in earlier works, were 7.5 au and 9.7 au within a mass range of 1–8 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We obtained 4.5 h of simultaneous low-resolution integral field spectroscopy ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ∼ 30, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater} − {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band with IFS) and dual-band imaging ({\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}1 and {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}2 bands with IRDIS) of the HR 8799 system, interspersed with observations of a reference star. The reference star was observed for about one-third of the total time and generally needs to be of similar brightness (Δ{\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≲ 1 mag) and separated on sky by ≲1–2°. The hops between stars were made every 6–10 min, with only 1 min gaps in on-sky integration per hop.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We did not detect the hypothetical fifth planet at the most plausible separations, 7.5 and 9.7 au, down to mass limits of 3.6 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and 2.8 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, respectively, but attained an unprecedented contrast limit of 11.2 magnitudes at 0.1″. We detected all four planets with high signal-to-noise ratios. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}YJH{\textless}i/{\textgreater} spectra for planets {\textless}i{\textgreater}c{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}d{\textless}i/{\textgreater} were detected with redder {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band spectral slopes than found in earlier studies. As noted in previous works, the planet spectra are matched very closely by some red field dwarfs. Finally, comparing the current locations of the planets to orbital solutions, we found that planets {\textless}i{\textgreater}e{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}c{\textless}i/{\textgreater} are most consistent with coplanar and resonant orbits. We also demonstrated that with star-hopping RDI, the contrast improvement at 0.1″ separation can be up to 2 mag.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Since ADI, meridian transit and the concomitant sky rotation are not needed, the time of observation can be chosen from within a window that is two to three times larger. In general, star-hopping can be used for stars fainter than {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 4 magnitudes, since for these a reference star of suitable brightness and separation is usually available.},

	abstract = {The Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) is a high-contrast instrument specially designed for direct imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets and debris disks. GPI can also operate as a dual-channel integral field polarimeter. The instrument primarily operates in a coronagraphic mode which poses an obstacle for traditional photometric calibrations since the majority of on-axis starlight is blocked. To enable accurate photometry relative to the occulted central star, a diffractive grid in a pupil plane is used to create a set of faint copies, named satellite spots, of the occulted star at specified locations and relative intensities in the field of view. We describe the method we developed to perform the photometric calibration of coronagraphic observations in polarimetry mode using these fiducial satellite spots. With the currently available data, we constrain the calibration uncertainty to be \&lt;13\%, but the actual calibration uncertainty is likely to be lower. We develop the associated calibration scripts in the GPI Data Reduction Pipeline, which is available to the public. For testing, we use it to photometrically calibrate the HD 19467 B and \&beta; Pic b data sets taken in the H-band polarimetry mode. We measure the calibrated flux of HD 19467 B and \&beta; Pic b to be 0:078\&plusmn;0:011 mJy and 4:87\&plusmn;0:73 mJy, both agreeing with other measurements found in the literature. Finally, we explore an alternative method which performs the calibration by scaling the photometry in polarimetry mode to the photometrically calibrated response in spectroscopy mode. By comparing the reduced observations in raw units, we find that observations in polarimetry mode are 1:03 0:01 brighter than those in spectroscopy mode.},

In all observations a radial limb polarization on the order of 1\% was detected with a position angle perpendicular to the limb. The polarization is higher in both planets for the shorter wavelength bands. As a first approximation, the polarization seems to be equally strong along the entire limb. This is unlike Jupiter and Saturn, where significant limb polarization is only observed at the poles. We determined flux-weighted averages of the limb polarization and radial limb polarization profiles, and investigated the degradation and cancellation effects in the polarization signal due to the seeing-limited spatial resolution of our observations. Taking this into account we derived corrected values for the limb polarization in Uranus and Neptune. The results are compared with analytic models for Rayleigh scattering atmospheres for the semi-infinite case and finite layers with ground albedo. The comparison shows that the detected polarization is compatible with expectations. This indicates that limb-polarization measurements offer a powerful diagnostic tool for investigating the properties of scattering particles in the upper atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune, in particular if more sophisticated numerical modeling of the limb polarization becomes available. It is also concluded from the overall strength of the limb polarization that the disk-integrated polarization of Uranus and Neptune for large phase angles is high (\%). This is of interest for future polarimetric detections of extra-solar planets with atmospheric properties similar to Uranus and Neptune.},

Its spectrum and luminosity are very well matched by 2MASS J0141-4633 and several other 12.5-15 M J free-floating members of the 40 Myr old Tuc-Hor Association, consistent with a system age derived from recent interferometric results for the primary, a companion mass at/near the deuterium-burning limit (\{13\}-2+12 MJ), and a companion-to-primary mass ratio characteristic of other directly imaged planets (q ∼ \{0.005\}-0.001+0.005). We did not unambiguously identify additional, more closely orbiting companions brighter and more massive than κ And b down to ρ ∼ 0.″3 (15 au). SCExAO/CHARIS and complementary Keck/NIRC2 astrometric points reveal clockwise orbital motion. Modeling points toward a likely eccentric orbit: a subset of acceptable orbits include those that are aligned with the star’s rotation axis. However, κ And b’s semimajor axis is plausibly larger than 55 au and in a region where disk instability could form massive companions. Deeper high-contrast imaging of κ And and low-resolution spectroscopy from extreme adaptive optics systems such as SCExAO/CHARIS and higher-resolution spectroscopy from Keck/OSIRIS or, later, IRIS on the Thirty Meter Telescope could help to clarify κ And b’s chemistry and whether its spectrum provides an insight into its formation environment.},

	abstract = {Context. The study of protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understand their evolution and interaction with the surrounding environment, and to constrain planet formation mechanisms. Aims. We aim at characterising the young binary system HD 34700 A, which shows a wealth of structures. Methods. Taking advantage of the high-contrast imaging instruments SPHERE at the VLT, LMIRCam at the LBT, and of ALMA observations, we analyse this system at multiple wavelengths. We study the rings and spiral arms morphology and the scattering properties of the dust. We discuss the possible causes of all the observed features. Results. We detect for the first time, in the H\$\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ band, a ring extending from \${\textbackslash}sim\$65 au to \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}\$120 au, inside the ring already known from recent studies. These two have different physical and geometrical properties. Based on the scattering properties, the outer ring may consist of grains of typical size \$a\_\{out\} {\textgreater} 4 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m\$, while the inner ring of smaller grains (\$a\_\{in\} {\textless}= 0.4 \{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$). Two extended logarithmic spiral arms stem from opposite sides of the disk. The outer ring appears as a spiral arm itself, with a variable radial distance from the centre and extended substructures. ALMA data confirm the presence of a millimetric dust substructure centred just outside the outer ring, and detect misaligned gas rotation patterns for HD 34700 A and B. Conclusions. The complexity of HD 34700 A, revealed by the variety of observed features, suggests the existence of one or more disk-shaping physical mechanisms. Possible scenarios, compatible with our findings, involve the presence inside the disk of a yet undetected planet of several Jupiter masses and the system interaction with the surroundings by means of gas cloudlet capture or flybys. Further observations with JWST/MIRI or ALMA (gas kinematics) could shed more light on these.},

It will improve the capabilities of the instrument for the detection and characterization of young giant planets. It includes a second stage adaptive optics system composed of a dedicated near-infrared wavefront sensor and a deformable mirror. This second stage will remove the residual wavefront errors left by the current primary AO loop (SAXO). This paper focuses on the numerical simulations of the second stage (SAXO+) and concludes on the impact of the main AO parameters used to build the design strategy. Using an end-to-end AO simulation tool (COMPASS), we investigate the impact of several parameters on the performance of the AO system. We measure the performance in minimizing the star residuals in the coronagraphic image. The parameters that we study are : the second stage frequency, the photon flux on each WFS, the first stage gain and the DM number of actuators of the second stage. We show that the performance is improved by a factor 10 with respect to the current AO system (SAXO). The optimal second stage frequency is between 1 and 2 kHz under good observing conditions. In a red star case, the best SAXO+ performance is achieved with a low first stage gain of 0.05, which reduces the first stage rejection.},

The azimuthally averaged radial profile of the PI shows a double power-law distribution, in which the PIs in r = 29–52 au and r = 81.2–145 au respectively show r−3 dependence. These two power-law regions are connected smoothly with a transition zone (TZ), exhibiting an apparent gap in r = 40–70 au. The PI in the inner power-law region shows a deep minimum whose location seems to coincide with the point source at λ = 7 mm. This can be regarded as another sign of a protoplanet in the TZ. The observed radial profile of the PI is reproduced by a minimally flaring disk with an irregular surface density distribution, an irregular temperature distribution, or with a combination of both. The depletion factor of surface density in the inner power-law region (r \&lt; 50 au) is derived to be ≥ 0.16 from a simple model calculation. The obtained PI image also shows small-scale asymmetries in the outer power-law region. Possible origins for these asymmetries include corrugation of the scattering surface in the outer region, and a shadowing effect by a puffed-up structure in the inner power-law region.},

	abstract = {It is critical for James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) science that instrumental units are converted to physical units. We detail the design of the JWST absolute flux calibration program that has the core goal of ensuring a robust flux calibration internal to and between all the science instruments for both point and extended source science. This program will observe a sample of calibration stars that have been extensively vetted based mainly on Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope, and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite observations. The program uses multiple stars of three different, well-understood types (hot stars, A dwarfs, and solar analogs) to allow for the statistical (within a type) and systematic (between types) uncertainties to be quantified. The program explicitly includes observations to calibrate every instrument mode, further vet the set of calibration stars, measure the instrumental repeatability, measure the relative calibration between subarrays and full frame, and check the relative calibration between faint and bright stars. For photometry, we have set up our calibration to directly support both the convention based on the band average flux density and the convention based on the flux density at a fixed wavelength.},

	abstract = {The proposed protoplanet AB Aur b is a spatially concentrated emission source imaged in the mm-wavelength disk gap of the Herbig Ae/Be star AB Aur. Its near-infrared spectrum and absence of strong polarized light have been interpreted as evidence supporting the protoplanet interpretation. However, the complex scattered light structures in the AB Aur disk pose challenges in resolving the emission source and interpreting the true nature of AB Aur b. We present new images of the AB Aur system obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical bands. AB Aur b and the known disk spirals are recovered in the F336W, F410M, and F645N bands. The spectral energy distribution of AB Aur b shows absorption in the Balmer jump, mimicking those of early-type stars. By comparing the colors of AB Aur b to those of the host star, the disk spirals, and predictions from scattered light and self-luminous models, we find that the emission from AB Aur b is inconsistent with planetary photospheric or accretion shock models. Instead, it is consistent with those measured in the circumstellar disks that trace scattered light. We conclude that the UV and visible emission from AB Aur b does not necessitate the presence of a protoplanet. We synthesize observational constraints on AB Aur b and discuss inconsistent interpretations of AB Aur b among different datasets. Considering the significance of the AB Aur b discovery, we advocate for further observational evidence to verify its planetary nature.},

	abstract = {The study of stellar surfaces can reveal information about the chemical composition, interior structure, and magnetic properties of stars. It is also critical to the detection and characterization of extrasolar planets, in particular those targeted in extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) searches, which must contend with stellar variability that is often orders of magnitude stronger than the planetary signal. One of the most successful methods to map the surfaces of stars is Doppler imaging, in which the presence of inhomogeneities is inferred from subtle line shape changes in high resolution stellar spectra. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient, and closed-form solution to the problem of Doppler imaging of stellar surfaces. Our model explicitly allows for incomplete knowledge of the local (rest frame) stellar spectrum, allowing one to learn differences from spectral templates while simultaneously mapping the stellar surface. It therefore works on blended lines, regions of the spectrum where line formation mechanisms are not well understood, or stars whose spots have intrinsically different spectra from the rest of the photosphere. We implement the model within the open source starry framework, making it fast, differentiable, and easy to use in both optimization and posterior inference settings. As a proof-of-concept, we use our model to infer the surface map of the brown dwarf WISE 1049-5319B, finding close agreement with the solution of Crossfield et al. (2014). We also discuss Doppler imaging in the context of EPRV studies and describe an interpretable spectral-temporal Gaussian process for stellar spectral variability that we expect will be important for EPRV exoplanet searches.},

	abstract = {Photometric and astrometric calibration of high-contrast images is essential for the characterization of companions at small angular separation from their stellar host. The main challenge to performing accurate relative photometry and astrometry of high-contrast companions with respect to the host star is that the central starlight cannot be directly used as a reference, as it is either blocked by a coronagraphic mask or saturating the detector. Our approach is to add fiducial incoherent faint copies of the host star in the image plane and alternate the pattern of these copies between exposures. Subtracting two frames with different calibration patterns removes measurement bias due to static and slowly varying incoherent speckle halo components, while ensuring that calibration references are inserted on each frame. Each calibration pattern is achieved by high-speed modulation of a pupil-plane deformable mirror to ensure incoherence. We implemented the technique on-sky on the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics instrument with speckles which were of the order of 103 times fainter than the central host. The achieved relative photometric and astrometric measurement precisions for 10 s exposure were respectively 5\% and 20 milliarcsecond. We also demonstrate, over a 540 s measurement span, that residual photometric and astrometric errors are uncorrelated in time, indicating that residual noise averages as the inverse square root of the number of exposures in longer time-series data sets.},

We describe the design, data reduction methods, and performance of polarimetry with GPI. Point-spread function (PSF) subtraction via differential polarimetry suppresses unpolarized starlight by a factor of over 100, and provides sensitivity to circumstellar dust reaching the photon noise limit for these observations. In the case of the circumstellar disk around HR 4796A, GPI's advanced adaptive optics system reveals the disk clearly even prior to PSF subtraction. In polarized light, the disk is seen all the way in to its semi-minor axis for the first time. The disk exhibits surprisingly strong asymmetry in polarized intensity, with the west side {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 9 times brighter than the east side despite the fact that the east side is slightly brighter in total intensity. Based on a synthesis of the total and polarized intensities, we now believe that the west side is closer to us, contrary to most prior interpretations. Forward scattering by relatively large silicate dust particles leads to the strong polarized intensity on the west side, and the ring must be slightly optically thick in order to explain the lower brightness in total intensity there. These findings suggest that the ring is geometrically narrow and dynamically cold, perhaps shepherded by larger bodies in the same manner as Saturn's F ring.},

This TIPTOP tool takes its roots in an analytical approach, where the simulations are done in the Fourier domain. This allows to reach a very fast computation time (few seconds per PSF), and efficiently explore the wide parameter space. TIPTOP has been developed in Python, taking advantage of previous work developed in different languages, and unifying them in a single framework.

The J- and H-band images reveal multiple spiral-arm structures outside a large (R = 0.″49 = 175 au) cavity, along with a bluish spiral structure inside the cavity. The cavity wall shows a strong discontinuity, and we clearly see significant non-azimuthal polarization Uϕ, consistent with multiple scattering within a disk at an inferred inclination ∼42°. Radiative transfer modeling along with a new Gaia distance suggest HD 37400A is a young (∼5 Myr) system consisting of two intermediate-mass (∼2 M⊙) stars surrounded by a transitional disk and not a solar-mass binary with a debris disk, as previously classified. Conventional assumptions of the dust-to-gas ratio would rule out a gravitational instability origin to the spirals while hydrodynamical models using the known external companion or a hypothetical massive protoplanet in the cavity both have trouble reproducing the relatively large spiral-arm pitch angles (∼30°) without fine-tuning of gas temperature. We explore the possibility that material surrounding a massive protoplanet could explain the rim discontinuity after also considering effects of shadowing by an inner disk. Analysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope data suggests the disk is rotating counterclockwise as expected from the spiral-arm structure and revealed a new low-mass companion at 6.″45 separation. We include an appendix that sets out clear definitions of Q, U, Qϕ, Uϕ, correcting some confusion and errors in the literature.},

We confirm the complex “double ring” structure for the nearly face-on system HD 169142 first seen in H-band, finding the outer ring to be substantially redder than the inner one in polarized intensity. Using radiative transfer modeling, we developed a physical model that explains the full spectral energy distribution and J- and H-band surface brightness profiles, suggesting that the differential color of the two rings could come from reddened starlight traversing the inner wall and may not require differences in grain properties. In addition, we clearly detect an elongated, off-center ring in HD 163296 (MWC 275), locating the scattering surface to be 18 au above the midplane at a radial distance of 77 au, co-spatial with a ring seen at 1.3 mm by ALMA linked to the CO snow line. Lastly, we report a weak tentative detection of scattered light for HD 150193 (MWC 863) and a non-detection for HD 144432; the stellar companion known for each of these targets has likely disrupted the material in the outer disk of the primary star. For HD 163296 and HD 169142, the prominent outer rings we detect could be evidence for giant planet formation in the outer disk or a manifestation of large-scale dust growth processes possibly related to snow-line chemistry.},

In the past 15 years, major developments in adaptive optics, coronagraphy, optical manufacturing, wavefront sensing, and data processing, together with a consistent global system analysis have brought about a new generation of high-contrast imagers and spectrographs on large ground-based telescopes with much better performance. One of the most productive imagers is the Spectro-Polarimetic High contrast imager for Exoplanets REsearch (SPHERE), which was designed and built for the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. SPHERE includes an extreme adaptive optics system, a highly stable common path interface, several types of coronagraphs, and three science instruments. Two of them, the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) and the Infra-Red Dual-band Imager and Spectrograph (IRDIS), were designed to efficiently cover the near-infrared range in a single observation for an efficient search of young planets. The third instrument, ZIMPOL, was designed for visible polarimetric observation to look for the reflected light of exoplanets and the light scattered by debris disks. These three scientific instruments enable the study of circumstellar environments at unprecedented angular resolution, both in the visible and the near-infrared. In this work, we thoroughly present SPHERE and its on-sky performance after four years of operations at the VLT.},

	abstract = {Diverse protoplanetary disk morphology can result from planet-disk interaction, suggesting planetary presence. To date, most scattered light imaging campaigns have probed polarized light, which is only a fraction of the total light and not very sensitive to planets. To observe and characterize protoplanetary disk systems in the near-infrared in both polarized and total intensity light, we carried out an unprecedented study of scattering properties of disks, as well as of any planetary companions. Using SPHERE with star-hopping at the Very Large Telescope, we observed 29 disk hosts and their reference stars in \$K\_s\$-band polarized light. We extracted disks in total intensity by adopting the data imputation concept with sequential non-negative matrix factorization (DI-sNMF). We obtained high-quality disk images in total intensity for 15 systems and in polarized light for 23. For well-recovered disks in polarized light and total intensity, we parameterized the polarization fraction phase functions using scaled beta distribution: the peak of polarization fraction tentatively correlates with the peak scattering angle, which could be reproduced using certain compact dust, yet more detailed modeling studies are needed. We investigated the empirical DI-sNMF detectability of disks using logistic regression: total intensity detectability of disks primarily depends on host star brightness. For disks with SPHERE data in \$Y\$-/\$J\$-/\$H\$-band, we summarized their polarized color at {\textasciitilde}90 deg scattering angle: most of disks are blue in polarized \$J-K\_s\$ color, and they are relatively redder as stellar luminosity increases, indicating larger scatterers. High-quality disk imagery in both total intensity and polarized light thus allows for disk characterization in polarization fraction, and reduces the confusion between disk and planetary signals.},

	abstract = {High angular resolution observations of young stellar objects are required to study the inner astronomical units of protoplanetary disks in which the majority of planets form. As they evolve, gaps open up in the inner disk regions and the disks are fully dispersed within ∼10 Myr. MWC 614 is a pretransitional object with a ∼10 au radius gap. We present a set of high angular resolution observations of this object including SPHERE/ZIMPOL polarimetric and coronagraphic images in the visible, Keck/NIRC2 near-infrared (NIR) aperture masking observations, and Very Large Telescope Interferometer (AMBER, MIDI, and PIONIER) and Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CLASSIC and CLIMB) long-baseline interferometry at infrared wavelengths. We find that all the observations are compatible with an inclined disk (i ∼ 55° at a position angle of ∼20°-30°). The mid-infrared data set confirms that the disk inner rim is at 12.3 ± 0.4 au from the central star. We determined an upper mass limit of 0.34 M ⊙ for a companion inside the cavity. Within the cavity, the NIR emission, usually associated with the dust sublimation region, is unusually extended (∼10 au, 30 times larger than the theoretical sublimation radius) and indicates a high dust temperature (T ∼ 1800 K). As a possible result of companion-induced dust segregation, quantum heated dust grains could explain the extended NIR emission with this high temperature. Our observations confirm the peculiar state of this object where the inner disk has already been accreted onto the star, exposing small particles inside the cavity to direct stellar radiation. Based on observations made with the Keck observatory (NASA program ID N104N2) and with ESO telescopes at the Paranal Observatory (ESO program IDs 073.C-0720, 077.C-0226, 077.C-0521, 083.C-0984, 087.C-0498(A), 190.C-0963, 095.C-0883) and with the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy observatory.},

VLT/SPHERE (Very Large Telescope/Spectro-Polarimetric High-​contrast Exoplanet REsearch) observations of the disc around HD 143006 show a large-scale asymmetry and two narrow dark lanes that are indicative of shadowing. ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) observations also reveal the presence of rings and gaps in the disc, along with a bright arc at large radii. We present new hydrodynamic simulations of HD 143006, and show that a configuration with both a strongly inclined binary and an outer planetary companion is the most plausible to explain the observed morphological features. We compute synthetic observations from our simulations, and successfully reproduce both the narrow shadows and the brightness asymmetry seen in infrared scattered light. Additionally, we reproduce the large dust observed in the mm continuum, due to a 10 Jupiter-mass planet detected in the CO kinematics. Our simulations also show the formation of a circumplanetary disc, which is misaligned with respect to the outer disc. The narrow shadows cast by the inner disc and the planet-induced ‘kink’ in the disc kinematics are both expected to move on a time-scale of ∼5–10 yr, presenting a potentially observable test of our model. If confirmed, HD 143006 would be the first known example of a circumbinary planet on a strongly misaligned orbit.},

	abstract = {We present multi-wavelength observations and a radiative transfer model of a newly discovered massive circumstellar disk of gas and dust which is one of the largest disks known today. Seen almost edge-on, the disk is resolved in high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) images and appears as a dark lane of high opacity intersecting a bipolar reflection nebula. Based on molecular line observations, we estimate the distance to the object to be 3.5 kpc. This leads to a size for the dark lane of {\textasciitilde}10,500 AU but due to shadowing effects the true disk size could be smaller. In Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 μm images, the elongated shape of the bipolar reflection nebula is still preserved and the bulk of the flux seems to come from disk regions that can be detected due to the slight inclination of the disk. At longer IRAC wavelengths, the flux is mainly coming from the central regions penetrating directly through the dust lane. Interferometric observations of the dust continuum emission at millimeter wavelengths with the Submillimeter Array confirm this finding as the peak of the unresolved millimeter-emission coincides perfectly with the peak of the Spitzer/IRAC 5.8 μm flux and the center of the dark lane seen in the NIR images. Simultaneously acquired CO data reveal a molecular outflow along the northern part of the reflection nebula which seems to be the outflow cavity. An elongated gaseous disk component is also detected and shows signs of rotation. The emission is perpendicular to the molecular outflow and thus parallel to but even more extended than the dark lane in the NIR images. Based on the dust continuum and the CO observations, we estimate a disk mass of up to a few solar masses depending on the underlying assumptions. Whether the disk-like structure is an actual accretion disk or rather a larger-scale flattened envelope or pseudodisk is difficult to discriminate with the current data set. The existence of HCO+/H13CO+ emission proves the presence of dense gas in the disk and the molecules' abundances are similar to those found in other circumstellar disks. We furthermore detected C2H toward the objects and discuss this finding in the context of star formation. Finally, we have performed radiative transfer modeling of the K-band scattered light image varying a disk plus outflow two-dimensional density profile and the stellar properties. The model approximately reproduces extent and location of the dark lane, and the basic appearance of the outflow. We discuss our findings in the context of circumstellar disks across all mass regimes and conclude that our discovery is an ideal laboratory to study the early phases in the evolution of massive circumstellar disks surrounding young stellar objects. Based on observations made at the Calar Alto Observatory. This work is based in part on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, and on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA.},

	abstract = {We made mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the 10 M sun Herbig Be star HD200775 with the Cooled Mid-Infrared Camera and Spectrometer on the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope. We discovered diffuse emission of an elliptical shape extended in the north-south direction in an {\textasciitilde}1000 AU radius around unresolved excess emission. The diffuse emission is perpendicular to the cavity wall formed by the past outflow activity and is parallel to the projected major axis of the central close binary orbit. The centers of the ellipse contours of the diffuse emission are shifted from the stellar position, and the amount of the shift increases as the contour brightness level decreases. The diffuse emission is well explained in all of geometry (the shape and the shift), size, and configuration by an inclined flared disk where only its surface emits the MIR photons. Our results give the first well-resolved infrared disk images around a massive star and strongly support that HD200775 is formed through the disk accretion. The disk survives the main accretion phase and shows a structure similar to that around lower mass stars with "disk atmosphere." At the same time, the disk also shows properties characteristic of massive stars such as photoevaporation traced by the 3.4 mm free-free emission and unusual silicate emission with a peak at 9.2 μm, which is shorter than that of many astronomical objects. It provides a good place to compare the disk properties between massive and lower mass stars.

Methods: We test the accuracy of seven independently developed radiative transfer codes by comparing the temperature structures, spectral energy distributions, scattered light images, and linear polarisation maps that each model predicts for a variety of disc opacities and viewing angles. The test cases have been chosen to be numerically challenging, with midplane optical depths up 10{\textasciicircum}6, a sharp density transition at the inner edge and complex scattering matrices. We also review recent progress in the implementation of the Monte Carlo method that allow an efficient solution to these kinds of problems and discuss the advantages and limitations of Monte Carlo codes compared to those of discrete ordinate codes. Results: For each of the test cases, the predicted results from the radiative transfer codes are within good agreement. The results indicate that these codes can be confidently used to interpret present and future observations of protoplanetary discs.},

	abstract = {Detection and characterization of extended structures is a crucial goal in high contrast imaging. However, these structures face challenges in data reduction, leading to over-subtraction from speckles and self-subtraction with most existing methods. Iterative post-processing methods offer promising results, but their integration into existing pipelines is hindered by selective algorithms, high computational cost, and algorithmic regularization. To address this for reference differential imaging (RDI), here we propose the data imputation concept to Karhunen-Loève transform (DIKL) by modifying two steps in the standard Karhunen-Loève image projection (KLIP) method. Specifically, we partition an image to two matrices: an anchor matrix which focuses only on the speckles to obtain the DIKL coefficients, and a boat matrix which focuses on the regions of astrophysical interest for speckle removal using DIKL components. As an analytical approach, DIKL achieves high-quality results with significantly reduced computational cost ({\textasciitilde}3 orders of magnitude less than iterative methods). Being a derivative method of KLIP, DIKL is seamlessly integrable into high contrast imaging pipelines for RDI observations.},

More than 4300 of those exoplanets have been cataloged by astronomers in that time. Statistical extrapolations from that population suggest that more than one planet orbits each star, on average.1 The big questions in astrophysics research have always been concerned with origins. The abundance of new worlds allows us to establish the context for our solar system and to refine ideas about the creation, evolution, and biological potential of planets. Of the many exciting discoveries made about exoplanets, perhaps the most profound is their diversity. No one knows how common a planetary configuration like our solar system may be, but it’s clear that a much broader range of planetary properties exists than we can find among our immediate neighbors. Much of that variety is thought to be imprinted at the epoch of planet formation.},

The disc appears inclined at 67-71°, with position angle, PA = -1.0 to 0.6°, consistent with previous estimates. The NIR scattering surface extends out to \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}75{\textbackslash},\$ au and we infer an aspect ratio, hscat(r)/r {\textasciitilde} 0.24 in J band; {\textasciitilde}0.22 in H band. Our Gemini Planet Imager images and VLTI + CHARA NIR interferometry suggest that the disc surface layers are populated by grains ≳λ/2π in size, indicating these grains are aerodynamically supported against settling and/or the density of smaller grains is relatively low. We demonstrate that our geometric analysis provides a reasonable assessment of the height of the NIR scattering surface at the outer edge of the disc and, if the inclination can be independently constrained, has the potential to probe the flaring exponent of the scattering surface in similarly inclined (i ≳ 70°) discs. In re-evaluating HD 145718's stellar properties, we found that the object's dimming events - previously characterized as UX Or and dipper variability - are consistent with dust occultation by grains larger, on average, than found in the ISM.

Most of the kinks are detected over a small range in both radial extent and velocity, suggesting a planetary origin, but for some of them foreground contamination prevents us from measuring their spatial and velocity extent. Because of the DSHARP limited spectral resolution and signal to noise in the 12CO J = 2-1 line, as well as cloud contamination, the kinks are usually detected in only one spectral channel, and will require confirmation. The strongest circumstantial evidence for protoplanets in the absence of higher spectral resolution data and additional tracers is that, upon deprojection, we find that all of the candidate planets lie within a gap and/or at the end of a spiral detected in dust continuum emission. This suggests that a significant fraction of the dust gaps and spirals observed by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in disks are caused by embedded protoplanets.},

	abstract = {We present Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) spectra of fourteen isolated Herbig Ae/Be (HAEBE) stars, to study the characteristics of their circumstellar dust. These spectra show large star-to-star differences, in the emission features of both carbon-rich and oxygen-rich dust grains. The IR spectra were combined with photometric data ranging from the UV through the optical into the sub-mm region. We defined two key groups, based upon the spectral shape of the infrared region. The derived results can be summarized as follows: (1) the continuum of the IR to sub-mm region of all stars can be reconstructed by the sum of a power-law and a cool component, which can be represented by a black body. Possible locations for these components are an optically thick, geometrically thin disc (power-law component) and an optically thin flared region (black body); (2) all stars have a substantial amount of cold dust around them, independent of the amount of mid-IR excess they show; (3) also the near-IR excess is unrelated to the mid-IR excess, indicating different composition/location of the emitting material; (4) remarkably, some sources lack the silicate bands; (5) apart from amorphous silicates, we find evidence for crystalline silicates in several stars, some of which are new detections; (6) PAH bands are present in at least 50\% of our sample, and their appearance is slightly different from PAHs in the ISM; (7) PAH bands are, with one exception, not present in sources which only show a power-law continuum in the IR; their presence is unrelated to the presence of the silicate bands; (8) the dust in HAEBE stars shows strong evidence for coagulation; this dust processing is unrelated to any of the central star properties (such as age, spectral type and activity).

	abstract = {Context. (Pre-)Transitional disks show gaps and cavities that can be related to ongoing planet formation. According to theory, young embedded planets can accrete material from the circumplanetary and circumstellar disks and can be detected using accretion tracers, such as the Hα emission line. Aims: We aim to detect accreting protoplanets within the cavities of five (pre-)transitional disks through adaptive-optics(AO)-assisted spectral angular differential imaging in the optical regime. Methods: We performed simultaneous AO observations in the Hα line and the adjacent continuum using the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE) with the Zurich Imaging Polarimeter (ZIMPOL) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). We combined spectral and angular differential imaging techniques to increase the contrast in the innermost regions close to the star and search for the signature of young accreting protoplanets. Results: The reduced images show no clear Hα point source around any of the targets. We report the presence of faint Hα emission around TW Hya and HD163296: while the former is most probably an artifact related to a spike, the nature of the latter remains unclear. The spectral and angular differential images yield contrasts of 6-8 magnitudes at {\textasciitilde}100 mas from the central stars, except in the case of LkCa15, with values of {\textasciitilde}3 mag. We used the contrast curves to estimate average upper limits to the Hα line luminosity of LHα {\textasciitilde} 5 × 10-6 L⊙ at separations ≥200 mas for TW Hya, RXJ1615, and T Cha, while for HD163296 and LkCa15 we derive values of {\textasciitilde}3 × 10−5 L⊙. We estimated upper limits to the accretion luminosity of potential protoplanets, obtaining that planetary models provide an average value of Lacc {\textasciitilde} 10−4 L⊙ at 200 mas, which is about two orders of magnitude higher than the Lacc estimated from the extrapolation of the LHα - Lacc stellar relationship. Conclusions: When considering all the objects observed with SPHERE/ZIMPOL in the Hα line, 5 in this work and 13 from the literature, we can explain the lack of protoplanet detections by a combination of factors, such as a majority of low-mass, low-accreting planets; potential episodic accretion; significant extinction from the circumstellar and circumplanetary disks; and the fact that the contrast is less favorable at separations of smaller than 100 mas, where giant planets are more likely to form.

Here we present 1.3 mm/230 GHz continuum images of 147 targets at 0.2 arcsec (28 au) resolution and a typical rms of 0.15 mJy. We detect a total of 133 discs, including the individual components of 11 binary systems and 1 triple system. 60 of these discs are spatially resolved. We find clear substructures (inner cavities, rings, gaps, and/or spiral arms) in eight of the sources and hints of such structures in another four discs. We construct the disc luminosity function for our targets and perform preliminary comparisons to other regions. A simple conversion between flux and dust mass (adopting standard assumptions) indicates that all discs detected at 1.3 mm are massive enough to form one or more rocky planets. In contrast, only ∼50 discs (∼1/3 of the sample) have enough mass in the form of dust to form the canonical 10 M⊕ core needed to trigger runaway gas accretion and the formation of gas giant planets, although the total mass of solids already incorporated into bodies larger than cm scales is mostly unconstrained. The distribution in continuum disc sizes in our sample is heavily weighted towards compact discs: most detected discs have radii \&lt; 15 au, while only 23 discs (\$\{{\textbackslash}sim \}15\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ of the targets) have radii \&gt; 30 au.},

We detect a number of additional features, including two gaps and a ring. The ring shows an overbrightness at a position angle (PA) of {\textasciitilde}140°, extending over a range in position angle of {\textasciitilde}60°, and two narrow dark regions. The two narrow dark lanes and the overall large-scale asymmetry are indicative of shadowing effects, likely due to a misaligned inner disk. We demonstrate the remarkable resemblance between the scattered light image of HD 143006 and a model prediction of a warped disk due to an inclined binary companion. The warped disk model, based on the hydrodynamic simulations combined with three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations, reproduces all major morphological features. However, it does not account for the observed overbrightness at PA {\textasciitilde} 140°.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Shadows have been detected in several protoplanetary disks, suggesting that misalignment in disks is not uncommon.

	abstract = {We introduce the Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project (DSHARP), one of the initial Large Programs conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The primary goal of DSHARP is to find and characterize substructures in the spatial distributions of solid particles for a sample of 20 nearby protoplanetary disks, using very high resolution (∼0.″035, or 5 au, FWHM) observations of their 240 GHz (1.25 mm) continuum emission. These data provide a first homogeneous look at the small-scale features in disks that are directly relevant to the planet formation process, quantifying their prevalence, morphologies, spatial scales, spacings, symmetry, and amplitudes, for targets with a variety of disk and stellar host properties. We find that these substructures are ubiquitous in this sample of large, bright disks. They are most frequently manifested as concentric, narrow emission rings and depleted gaps, although large-scale spiral patterns and small arc-shaped azimuthal asymmetries are also present in some cases. These substructures are found at a wide range of disk radii (from a few astronomical units to more than 100 au), are usually compact (≲10 au), and show a wide range of amplitudes (brightness contrasts). Here we discuss the motivation for the project, describe the survey design and the sample properties, detail the observations and data calibration, highlight some basic results, and provide a general overview of the key conclusions that are presented in more detail in a series of accompanying articles. The DSHARP data—including visibilities, images, calibration scripts, and more—are released for community use at https://almascience.org/alma-data/lp/DSHARP.},

The targets consist of 16 Herbig Ae/Be stars (15 Herbig Ae stars and one Herbig Be star) and four additional main-sequence stars with infrared excesses. Five protoplanetary disks have been spatially resolved around the Herbig Ae stars with ages of 2-8 Myr. The resolved disks have outer radii of several 100 AU, and their surface brightnesses range from 10 mag arcsec-2 to 18 mag arcsec-2. The images reveal various morphologies in optically thick disks: spiral arms around AB Aur, a banana-split structure with an outer arm for HD 142527, a compact circumprimary disk of HD 150193, a faint discontinuous ring around HD 163296, and an unstructured face-on disk of HD 169142. The detection of an optically thick disk in scattered light implies that it is vertically flared, and intercepts stellar light at least in the outer region where those images were obtained. However, the surface brightness distribution, the resolved structure, and other observational characteristics suggest that the disks are unlikely to be continuously flared young disks with small grains well mixed with gas. The detection rate and the disk brightness do not correlate with the stellar age and the disk mass, but there is a tendency that the brightest disks are still surrounded by long-lived envelopes (AB Aur, HD 100546, HD 142527). The significant diversity of the disk structure can be attributed to the multiplicity and the initial condition of the local star-forming environments. The detections of companion candidates around our targeted stars are also reported.},

The outer disk is revealed in reprocessed archival Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS-F110W images, as well as new coronagraphic H-band images from the Very Large Telescope SPHERE instrument. The disk extends from 1.″1 (65 au) to 4.″6 (250 au) and is seen at an inclination of 73°, which refines previous measurements at lower angular resolution. We also report no companion detection larger than 3 MJup at projected separations beyond 20 au from the star (0.″34). Comparison between the F110W and H-band images is consistent with a gray color of 49 Ceti’s dust, indicating grains larger than ≳2 μm. Our photometric measurements indicate a scattering efficiency/infrared excess ratio of 0.2–0.4, relatively low compared to other characterized debris disks. We find that 49 Ceti presents morphological and scattering properties very similar to the gas-rich HD 131835 system. From our constraint on the disk inclination we find that the atomic gas previously detected in absorption must extend to the inner disk, and that the latter must be depleted of CO gas. Building on previous studies, we propose a schematic view of the system describing the dust and gas structure around 49 Ceti and hypothetical scenarios for the gas nature and origin.},

All observations successfully detect the disks, which appear vastly different in size, from ≈80 au in scattered light to {\textgreater}400 au, and display total polarized disk fluxes between 0.06\% and 0.89\% of the stellar flux. For five of these disks, we are able to determine the three-dimensional structure and the flaring of the disk surface, which appears to be relatively consistent across the different disks, with flaring exponents α between ≈1.1 and ≈1.6. We also confirm literature results with regard to the inclination and position angle of several of our disks and are able to determine which side is the near side of the disk in most cases. While there is a clear trend of disk mass with stellar ages (≈1 to {\textgreater}10 Myr), no correlations of disk structures with age were found. There are also no correlations with either stellar mass or submillimeter flux. We do not detect significant differences between the J and H bands. However, we note that while a high fraction (7/8) of the disks in our sample show ring-shaped substructures, none of them display spirals, in contrast to the disks around more massive Herbig Ae/Be stars, where spiral features are common.

We targeted nearby (≲150 pc), young (≲500 Myr) stars with high infrared (IR) excesses (LIR/L⋆ {\textgreater} 10−5), including 38 with previously resolved disks. Observations were made using the GPI high-contrast integral field spectrograph in H-band (1.6 μm) coronagraphic polarimetry mode to measure both polarized and total intensities. We resolved 26 debris disks and 3 protoplanetary/transitional disks. Seven debris disks were resolved in scattered light for the first time, including newly presented HD 117214 and HD 156623, and we quantified basic morphologies of five of them using radiative transfer models. All of our detected debris disks except HD 156623 have dust-poor inner holes, and their scattered-light radii are generally larger than corresponding radii measured from resolved thermal emission and those inferred from spectral energy distributions. To assess sensitivity, we report contrasts and consider causes of nondetections. Detections were strongly correlated with high IR excess and high inclination, although polarimetry outperformed total intensity angular differential imaging for detecting low-inclination disks (≲70°). Based on postsurvey statistics, we improved upon our presurvey target prioritization metric predicting polarimetric disk detectability. We also examined scattered-light disks in the contexts of gas, far-IR, and millimeter detections. Comparing H-band and ALMA fluxes for two disks revealed tentative evidence for differing grain properties. Finally, we found no preference for debris disks to be detected in scattered light if wide-separation substellar companions were present.},

	abstract = {We have developed the near-infrared high-spatial resolution imaging and spectro-polarimetric modes with the laser guide adaptive optics system (AO188) and the Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) of the 8.2-m Subaru telescope. A LiNbO$_{\textrm{3}}$ Wollaston prism (as dual beam analyzer) and focal plane masks were installed into the camera section of the IRCS cryostat, enabling us to perform the low- and medium-resolution grism spectropolarimetry (\&lambda;/\&Delta;\&lambda; = 100-1960) as well as the imaging-polarimetry, in conjunction with a half-wave retarder, which had been introduced for the HiCIAO instrument originally, at the front of the AO188 system. The designed wavelength coverage of the Wollaston prism is 0.8-5 \&mu;m, although the polarimetry at the 0.95-2.5 \&mu;m region is presented in this paper because of the limitations on the current retarder and the dichroic beam splitter of AO188. The focal plane masks, which are reflecting mirror or slits made with tungsten carbide, provide two or four rectangular focal plane apertures with an individual field of view of 4.4 arcsec \&times; 21 arcsec or 4.4 \&times; 54 arcsec for the imaging-polarimetry, or two or four slits with a width of 0.10, 0.15, 0.225, and 0.60 arcsec and a length of 4.4 arcsec for the spectro-polarimetry. The Wollaston prism and polarimetry masks were installed on June and July 2013, and the polarimetric modes had the first light on October 2013. The polarization efficiency is 88-96\% and 55-80\% at maximum for the imaging- and spectro-polarimetry, respectively, and it depends heavily on the angle of image rotator of AO188. The measured instrumental polarization, which is introduced by the telescope tertiary mirror mainly, is 0.3-0.7\%. We describe the design and current performance of the polarimetric function in the near-infrared region.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The characterization of the dust in protoplanetary disks is important for a better understanding of the resulting composition of forming planets and the dust particle evolution in these systems.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We aim to accurately characterize the properties of the dust in the face-on transition disk around RX J1604.3–213010 (RX J1604) by analyzing the multiwavelength scattered light intensity and polarization images obtained with the ZIMPOL and IRDIS subinstruments of VLT/SPHERE.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We used archival data of RX J1604 from the ESO archive and carefully corrected the polarization signal for instrumental effects, also taking the interstellar polarization into account. We measured the radial profiles of the disk for the azimuthal polarization, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Q{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}φ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}), in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}R, J{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater} bands and describe variations in our data due to the seeing and other effects. We derived the intrinsic polarization profiles of the disk, , by comparing the data with rotationally symmetric models convolved with the point spread functions of the observations. We also measured the disk intensity, {\textless}i{\textgreater}I{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}disk{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}), with reference star differential imaging for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater} bands. This provides the disk-integrated polarized intensity, , for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater} bands and the averaged fractional polarization, , for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater} bands. We investigated the azimuthal dependence of the scattered light and the shadows produced by hot dust near the star. The derived results were finally compared with model calculations to constrain the scattering properties of the reflecting dust in RX J1604.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} RX J1604 is a dipper source, and the data show different kinds of variability. However, a detailed analysis of repeated measurements shows that the results are not affected by dipping events or atmospheric seeing variations. We derive accurate radial disk profiles for the intrinsic polarized intensity, , and measure different profile peak radii for different bands because of the wavelength dependence of the dust opacity. The disk-integrated polarization is for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band and 1.51 ± 0.11\% for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band, indicating a red color for the polarized reflectivity of the disk. The intensity of the disk is {\textless}i{\textgreater}I{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}disk{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textbar}{\textless}i{\textgreater}I{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}*{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 3.9 ± 0.5\% in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band, and the fractional polarization is for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band and 42 ± 2\% for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band. The comparison with the IR excess for RX J1604 yields an apparent disk albedo of about Λ{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}Ι{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ≈ 0.16 ± 0.08. We also find that previously described shadows seen in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band data are likely affected by calibration errors. We derive, using dust scattering models for transition disks, approximate {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band values for the scattering albedo {\textless}i{\textgreater}ω{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≈ 0.5, scattering asymmetry {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≈ 0.5, and scattering polarization {\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}max{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ≈ 0.7 for the dust.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The bright disk of RX J1604 has a very simple axisymmetric structure and is therefore well suited as a benchmark object for accurate photo-polarimetric measurements. We derive values for the disk polarization, , and the apparent disk albedo, Λ{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}Ι{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band. Because and Λ{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}Ι{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} depend predominantly on dust scattering parameters and only weakly on the disk geometry, these parameters define tight relations for the dust scattering parameters between {\textless}i{\textgreater}ω{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and between {\textless}i{\textgreater}ω{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. The positive {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} to {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band color for the polarized reflectivity, , is mainly a result of the wavelength dependence of dust parameters because the scattering geometry is expected to be very similar for different colors. This work demonstrates the potential of accurate photo-polarimetric measurements of the circumstellar disk RX J1604 for the determination of dust scattering parameters that strongly constrain the physical properties of the dust.},

We describe the pipeline procedures, calibration results, and capabilities in processing imaging data acquired via the angular differential imaging and spectral differential imaging observing techniques. We showcase its performance on extracting spectra of injected synthetic point sources as well as compare the extracted spectra from real data sets on HD 33632 and HR 8799 to results in the literature.

	abstract = {The Coronagraph Instrument of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman Coronagraph) will be capable of both total intensity and polarization measurements of circumstellar disks. The polarimetric performance is impacted by polarization effects introduced by all mirrors before the Wollaston prisms.

We simulate the effect of polarization aberrations that impact the polarimetric contrast and the instrumental polarization effects to study the polarimetric accuracy. We include spacecraft rolls, but leave out systematic camera noise. We find that polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) improves the contrast by a factor of six. The PDI contrast of \${\textbackslash}sim 8 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-11\}\$ is limited by polarized speckles from instrumental polarization effects and polarization aberrations.

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2308.10940},
	abstract = {(Abridged) Context. To directly image rocky exoplanets in reflected (polarized) light, future space- and ground-based high-contrast imagers and telescopes aim to reach extreme contrasts at close separations from the star. However, the achievable contrast will be limited by reflection-induced polarization aberrations. While polarization aberrations can be modeled numerically, such computations provide little insight into the full range of effects, their origin and characteristics, and possible ways to mitigate them. Aims. We aim to understand polarization aberrations produced by reflection off flat metallic mirrors at the fundamental level. Methods. We used polarization ray tracing to numerically compute polarization aberrations and interpret the results in terms of the polarization-dependent spatial and angular Goos-Hänchen and Imbert-Federov shifts of the beam of light as described with closed-form mathematical expressions in the physics literature. Results. We find that all four beam shifts are fully reproduced by polarization ray tracing and study the origin, characteristics, sizes, and directions of the shifts. Of the four beam shifts, only the spatial Goos-Hänchen and Imbert-Federov shifts are relevant for high-contrast imagers and telescopes because these shifts are visible in the focal plane and create a polarization structure in the PSF that reduces the performance of coronagraphs and the polarimetric speckle suppression close to the star. Conclusions. The beam shifts in an optical system can be mitigated by keeping the f-numbers large and angles of incidence small. Most importantly, mirror coatings should not be optimized for maximum reflectivity, but should be designed to have a retardance close to 180°. The insights from our study can be applied to improve the performance of current and future high-contrast imagers, especially those in space and on the ELTs.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}R Aqr is a symbiotic binary system consisting of a mira variable, a hot companion with a spectacular jet outflow, and an extended emission line nebula. Because of its proximity to the Sun, this object has been studied in much detail with many types of high resolution imaging and interferometric techniques. We have used R Aqr as test target for the visual camera subsystem ZIMPOL, which is part of the new extreme adaptive optics (AO) instrument SPHERE at the Very Large Telescope (VLT).{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We describe SPHERE/ZIMPOL test observations of the R Aqr system taken in H{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and other filters in order to demonstrate the exceptional performance of this high resolution instrument. We compare our observations with data from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Hubble {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Space Telescope (HST) and illustrate the complementarity of the two instruments. We use our data for a detailed characterization of the inner jet region of R Aqr.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We analyze the high resolution ≈ 25 mas images from SPHERE/ZIMPOL and determine from the H{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} emission the position, size, geometric structure, and line fluxes of the jet source and the clouds in the innermost region {\textless}2′′ ({\textless}400 AU) of R Aqr. The data are compared to simultaneous HST line filter observations. The H{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} fluxes and the measured sizes of the clouds yield H{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} emissivities for many clouds from which one can derive the mean density, mass, recombination time scale, and other cloud parameters.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Our H{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data resolve for the first time the R Aqr binary and we measure for the jet source a relative position 45 mas West (position angle −89.5°) of the mira. The central jet source is the strongest H{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} component with a flux of about 2.5 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-12{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} erg cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. North east and south west from the central source there are many clouds with very diverse structures. Within 0.5′′ (100 AU) we see in the SW a string of bright clouds arranged in a zig-zag pattern and, further out, at 1′′−2′′, fainter and more extended bubbles. In the N and NE we see a bright, very elongated filamentary structure between 0.2′′−0.7′′ and faint perpendicular “wisps” further out. Some jet clouds are also detected in the ZIMPOL [O I] and He I filters, as well as in the HST-WFC3 line filters for H{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, [O III], [N II], and [O I]. We determine jet cloud parameters and find a very well defined correlation {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}e{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ∝ {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1.3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} between cloud density and distance to the central binary. Densities are very high with typical values of {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}e{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ≈ 3 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}5{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} for the “outer” clouds around 300 AU, {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}e{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ≈ 3 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}6{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} for the “inner” clouds around 50 AU, and even higher for the central jet source. The high {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}e{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} of the clouds implies short recombination or variability timescales of a year or shorter.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}H{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} high resolution data provide a lot of diagnostic information for the ionized jet gas in R Aqr.

The YJH colours we extracted for the object are consistent with tracing scattered starlight, suggesting that the protoplanet is enshrouded in a significant amount of dust, as expected for a circumplanetary disc or envelope surrounding a gap-clearing Jovian-mass protoplanet.},

We re-calculated the stellar and disk properties from the newly available {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 and related these properties with the disk categories.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} More than half of our sample shows disk substructures. For the remaining sources, the absence of detected features is due to their faintness, their small size, or the disk geometry. Faint disks are typically found around young stars and typically host no cavity. There is a possible dichotomy in the near-infrared (NIR) excess of sources with spiral-disks (high) and ring-disks (low). Like spirals, shadows are associated with a high NIR excess. If we account for the pre-main sequence evolutionary timescale of stars with different mass, spiral arms are likely associated with old disks. We also found a loose, shallow declining trend for the disk dust mass with time.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Protoplanetary disks may form substructures like rings very early in their evolution but their detectability in scattered light is limited to relatively old sources ( ≳5 Myr) where the recurrently detected disk cavities cause the outer disk to be illuminate. The shallow decrease of disk mass with time might be due to a selection effect, where disks observed thus far in scattered light are typically massive, bright transition disks with longer lifetimes than most disks. Our study points toward spirals and shadows being generated by planets of a fraction of a Jupiter mass to a few Jupiter masses in size that leave their (observed) imprint on both the inner disk near the star and the outer disk cavity.},

	abstract = {Context. Planets form in circumstellar disks around pre-main-sequence stars. A key question is, how do the formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks depend on stellar mass? Studies of circumstellar disks at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths around intermediate-mass Herbig Ae/Be stars have revealed disk structures such as cavities, gaps, and spiral arms. The Herbig Ae/Be stars represent an older population of intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence stars. Since these evolve toward the main sequence on timescales comparable to those of typical disk dissipation, a full picture of disk dispersal in intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence stars must include the intermediate-mass T Tauri (IMTT) stars. Aims: We seek to find the precursors of the Herbig Ae/Be stars in the solar vicinity within 500 pc from the Sun. We do this by creating an optically selected sample of IMTT stars from the literature, here defined as stars of masses 1.5 M⊙≤ M*≤ 5 M⊙ and with a spectral type between F and K3. Methods: We used literature optical photometry (0.4-1.25 μm) and distances determined from Gaia DR2 parallax measurements together with Kurucz stellar model spectra to place the stars in a HR diagram. We employed Siess evolutionary tracks to identify IMTT stars from the literature and derived masses and ages. We used Spitzer spectra to classify the disks around the stars into Meeus Group I and Group II disks based on their [F30/F13.5] spectral index. We also examined the 10 μm silicate dust grain emission and identified emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). From this, we built a qualitative picture of the disks around the IMTT stars and compared this with available spatially resolved images at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths to confirm our classification. Results: We find 49 IMTT stars with infrared excess. The identified disks are similar to the older Herbig Ae/Be stars in disk geometries and silicate dust grain population. The detection frequency of PAHs is higher than from disks around lower mass T Tauri stars but less frequent than from Herbig Ae/Be disks. Spatially resolved images at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths suggest gaps, and spirals are also present around the younger precursors to the Herbig Ae/Be stars. Conclusions: Comparing the timescale of stellar evolution toward the main sequence and current models of protoplanetary disk evolution, the similarity between Herbig Ae/Be stars and the IMTT stars points toward an evolution of Group I and Group II disks that are disconnected and represent two different evolutionary paths.},

The 44 targets were chosen based on their near- and mid-infrared colors, with roughly equal numbers of transitional, pre-transitional, and full disks. Our approach explicitly did not favor well-known, “famous” disks or those observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, resulting in a less-biased sample suitable to probe the major stages of disk evolution during planet formation. Our optimized data reduction allowed polarized flux as low as 0.002\% of the stellar light to be detected, and we report polarized scattered light around 80\% of our targets. We detected point-like companions for 47\% of the targets, including three brown dwarfs (two confirmed, one new), and a new super-Jupiter-mass candidate around V1295 Aql. We searched for correlations between the polarized flux and system parameters, finding a few clear trends: the presence of a companion drastically reduces the polarized flux levels, far-IR excess correlates with polarized flux for nonbinary systems, and systems hosting disks with ring structures have stellar masses {\textless}3 M⊙. Our sample also included four hot, dusty “FS CMa” systems, and we detected large-scale ( {\textgreater}100 au) scattered light around each, signs of extreme youth for these enigmatic systems.

Our propensity to study bright and extended objects does, however, bias our view of the disk demography. In this work, we aim to help alleviate this bias by analyzing fifteen disks targeted with VLT/SPHERE that look faint in scattered light. Sources were selected based on a low far-infrared excess from the spectral energy distribution. The comparison with the ALMA images available for a few sources shows that the scattered light surveyed by these datasets is only detected from a small portion of the disk extent. The mild anticorrelation between the disk brightness and the near-infrared excess demonstrates that these disks are self-shadowed: the inner disk rim intercepts much starlight and leaves the outer disk in penumbra. Based on the uniform distribution of the disk brightness in scattered light across all spectral types, self-shadowing would act similarly for inner rims at a different distance from the star. We discuss how the illumination pattern of the outer disk may evolve with time. Some objects in the sample are proposed to be at an intermediate stage toward bright disks from the literature, with either no shadow or with signs of azimuthally confined shadows.},

	abstract = {Dust particles are the building blocks from which planetary bodies are made. A major goal of the studies of planet-forming disks is to constrain the properties of dust particles and aggregates in order to trace their origin, structure, and the associated growth and mixing processes in the disk. Observations of scattering and/or emission of dust in a location of the disk often lead to degenerate information about the kind of particles, such as size, porosity, or fractal dimension of aggregates. Progress can be made by deriving the full (polarizing) scattering phase function of such particles at multiple wavelengths. This has now become possible by careful extraction from scattered light images. Such an extraction requires knowledge about the shape of the scattering surface in the disk and we discuss how to obtain such knowledge as well as the associated uncertainties. We use a sample of disk images from observations with VLT/SPHERE to, for the first time, extract the phase functions of a whole sample of disks with broad phase angle coverage. We find that polarized phase functions come in two categories. Comparing the extracted functions with theoretical predictions from rigorous T-Matrix computations of aggregates, we show that one category can be linked back to fractal, porous aggregates, while the other is consistent with more compact, less porous aggregates. We speculate that the more compact particles become visible in disks where embedded planets trigger enhanced vertical mixing.},

Its emission is reproducible as reprocessed radiation from an embedded protoplanet. We also identify two structures located at 430-580 au that are candidate sites of planet formation.

	abstract = {Direct imaging of protoplanetary discs promises to provide key insight into the complex sequence of processes by which planets are formed. However, imaging the innermost region of such discs (a zone critical to planet formation) is challenging for traditional observational techniques (such as near-IR imaging and coronagraphy) due to the relatively long wavelengths involved and the area occulted by the coronagraphic mask. Here, we introduce a new instrument – Visible Aperture-Masking Polarimetric Interferometer for Resolving Exoplanetary Signatures (VAMPIRES) – which combines non-redundant aperture-masking interferometry with differential polarimetry to directly image this previously inaccessible innermost region. By using the polarization of light scattered by dust in the disc to provide precise differential calibration of interferometric visibilities and closure phases, VAMPIRES allows direct imaging at and beyond the telescope diffraction limit. Integrated into the SCExAO (Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics) system at the Subaru telescope, VAMPIRES operates at visible wavelengths (where polarization is high) while allowing simultaneous infrared observations conducted by HICIAO. Here, we describe the instrumental design and unique observing technique and present the results of the first on-sky commissioning observations, validating the excellent visibility and closure-phase precision which are then used to project expected science performance metrics.},

Unlike most other inclined debris disks imaged at visible wavelengths, the cold disk around HD 53143 appears as disconnected “arcs” of material, with no forward-scattering side detected to date. We present new, deeper Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph coronagraphic observations of the HD 53143 debris disk and show that the forward-scattering side of the disk remains undetected. By fitting our KLIP-reduced observations via forward modeling with an optically thin disk model, we show that fitting the visible wavelength images with an azimuthally symmetric disk with unconstrained orientation results in an unphysical edge-on orientation that is at odds with recent ALMA observations, while constraining the orientation to that observed by ALMA results in nearly isotropically scattering dust. We show that the HD 53143 host star exhibits significant stellar variations due to spot rotation and revisit age estimates for this system.},

	abstract = {High-contrast imaging presents us with the opportunity to study circumstellar disks and the planets still embedded within them, providing key insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. However, the postprocessing techniques that are often needed to suppress stellar halo light typically result in significant and variable loss of circumstellar light, even when using relatively conservative approaches like reference star differential imaging (RDI). We introduce “constrained reference star differential imaging” (constrained RDI), a new class of RDI point-spread-function (PSF) subtraction techniques for systems with circumstellar disks. Constrained RDI utilizes either high-resolution polarized-intensity (PI) images or disk models to severely limit or even eliminate the signal loss due to oversubtraction that is common to RDI. We demonstrate the ability of constrained RDI utilizing polarimetric data to yield an oversubtraction-free detection of the AB Aurigae protoplanetary disk in total intensity. PI-constrained RDI allows us to decisively recover the spectral signature of the confirmed, recently discovered protoplanet, AB Aurigae b. We further demonstrate that constrained RDI can be a powerful analysis tool for soon-to-be-acquired James Webb Space Telescope coronagraphic imaging of disks. In both cases, constrained RDI provides analysis-ready products that enable more detailed studies of disks and more robust verification of embedded exoplanets.},

We obtained direct imaging observations and analyzed the TESS photometric time series data of this target with the goal of searching for planetary companions to HD 114082 and characterizing the morphology of the debris disk and the scattering properties of dust particles.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} HD 114082 was observed with the VLT/SPHERE instrument in different modes – the IRDIS camera in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band (2.0–2.3 μm) together with the IFS in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater} bands (0.95–1.66 μm) using the angular differential imaging technique as well as IRDIS in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band (1.5–1.8 μm) and ZIMPOL in the I\_PRIME band (0.71–0.87 μm) using the polarimetric differential imaging technique. To constrain the basic geometrical parameters of the disk and the scattering properties of dust grains, scattered light images were fitted with a 3D model for single scattering in an optically thin dust disk using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We performed aperture photometry to derive the scattering and polarized phase functions, the polarization fraction, and the spectral scattering albedo for the dust particles in the disk. This method was also used to obtain the reflectance spectrum of the disk and, in turn, to retrieve the disk color and study the dust reflectivity in comparison to the debris disk HD 117214. We also performed the modeling of the HD 114082 light curve measured by TESS using models for planet transit and stellar activity to put constraints on the radius of the detected planet and its orbit. Last, we searched for additional planets in the system by combining archival radial velocity data, astrometry, and direct imaging.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The debris disk HD 114082 appears as an axisymmetric debris belt with a radius of {\textasciitilde}0.37″ (35 au), an inclination of {\textasciitilde}83°, and a wide inner cavity. Dust particles in HD 114082 have a maximum polarization fraction of {\textasciitilde}17\% and a higher reflectivity when compared to the debris disk HD 117214. This high reflectivity results in a spectral scattering albedo of {\textasciitilde}0.65 for the HD 114082 disk at near-infrared wavelengths. The disk reflectance spectrum exhibits a red color at the position of the planetesimal belt and shows no obvious features, whereas that of HD 117214 might indicate the presence of CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ice. The analysis of TESS photometric data reveals a transiting planetary companion to HD 114082 with a radius of {\textasciitilde}1 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} on an orbit with a semimajor axis of 0.7 ± 0.4 au.

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Many scattered light images of protoplanetary disks have been obtained with the new generation of adaptive optics (AO) systems at large telescopes. The measured scattered radiation can be used to constrain the dust that forms planets in these disks.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We want to constrain the dust particle properties for the bright, pole-on transition disk around HD 169142 with accurate measurements and a quantitative analysis for the polarization and intensity of the scattered radiation.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We investigate high resolution imaging polarimetry of HD 169142 taken in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}′ and {\textless}i{\textgreater}I{\textless}i/{\textgreater}′ bands with the SPHERE/ZIMPOL AO instrument. The geometry of this pole-on disk is close to rotational symmetry, and we can use azimuthally averaged radial profiles for our analysis. We describe the dependence of the disk polarimetry on the atmospheric turbulence, which strongly impacts the AO point spread function (PSF). With non-coronagraphic data we can analyze the polarimetric signal of the disk simultaneously with the stellar PSF and determine the polarization of the disk based on simulations of the PSF convolution. We also extract the disk intensity signal and derive the fractional polarization for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}′ and {\textless}i{\textgreater}I{\textless}i/{\textgreater}′ bands. We compare the scattered flux from the inner and outer disk rings with the corresponding thermal dust emissions measured in the IR and estimate the ratio between scattered and absorbed radiation.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We find for the inner and outer disk rings of HD 169142 mean radii of 170 ± 3 mas and 522 ± 20 mas, respectively, and the same small deviations from a perfect ring geometry as previous studies. The AO performance shows strong temporal variation because of the mediocre seeing of about 1.1″; this produces PSF peak variations of up to a factor of four and strongly correlated changes for the measured disk polarization of about a factor of two for the inner disk ring and about 1.2 for the more extended outer disk. This variable PSF convolution effect can be simulated and accurately corrected, and we obtain ratios between the integrated disk polarization flux and total system flux ( ) of 0.43 ± 0.01\% for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}′ band and 0.55 ± 0.01\% for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}I{\textless}i/{\textgreater}′ band. This indicates a reddish color for the light reflection by the dust. The inner disk ring contributes about 75\% and the outer disk about 25\% to the total disk flux. The extraction of the scattered intensity of the disk is only possible for the bright, narrow, inner disk ring, and the obtained fractional polarization for the scattered radiation is 23.6 ± 3.5\% for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}I{\textless}i/{\textgreater}′ band and 22.0 ± 5.9\% for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}′ band. The ratio between scattered disk flux and star flux ( ) is about 2.3 ± 0.3\%. This is much smaller than the derived IR excess {\textless}i{\textgreater}F{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}fIR{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}F{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⋆{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 17.6\% for the disk components observed in scattered light. This indicates that only a small fraction of the radiation illuminating the disk is scattered; most is absorbed and reemitted in the IR.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We demonstrate the feasibility of accurate quantitative photo-polarimetry of a circumstellar disk with a radius of less than 0.2″, observed with ground-based AO systems, if the PSF convolution effects can be properly taken into account. Accurate measurements are a pre-requisite for finding differences in the dust properties for different disks. The derived fractional polarization of about 23\% in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}′ and {\textless}i{\textgreater}I{\textless}i/{\textgreater}′ bands for the compact (20 AU) inner disk of HD 169142 is lower than the measurement for the more extended disk HD 142527 for the same wavelength range and significantly lower than the estimates for near-IR data of other extended protoplanetary disks.},

We present Submillimeter Array observations of HD 34700: two Herbig Ae stars in a close binary system (Aa/Ab, ∼0.25 au), surrounded by a disk presenting a large cavity and spiral arms seen in scattered light, and two distant, lower-mass companions. These observations include 1.3 mm continuum emission and the 12CO 2–1 line at ∼05 (178 au) resolution. They resolve a prominent azimuthal asymmetry in the continuum and Keplerian rotation of a circumbinary disk in the 12CO line. The asymmetry is located at a radius of 155+11 −7 au, consistent with the edge of the scattered-light cavity, being resolved in both radius (72 +14 −15 au) and azimuth (FWHM = 64°+8 −7). The strong asymmetry in millimeter continuum emission could be evidence for a dust trap, together with the more symmetric morphology of 12CO emission and small grains. We hypothesize an unseen circumbinary companion responsible for the cavity in scattered light and creating a vortex at the cavity edge that manifests in dust trapping. The disk mass has limitations imposed by the detection of 12CO and nondetection of 13CO. We discuss its consequences for the potential past gravitational instability of this system, likely accounting for the rapid formation of a circumbinary companion. We also report the discovery of resolved continuum emission associated with HD 34700B (projected separation ∼1850 au), which we explain through a circumstellar disk.},

In the ESO DESTINYS large program, we study these disks within the first 10 Myr of their development with near-infrared scattered-light imaging. Here we present VLT/SPHERE polarimetric observations of the nearby class II system SU Aur in which we resolve the disk down to scales of ∼7 au. In addition to the new SPHERE observations, we utilize VLT/NACO, HST/STIS, and ALMA archival data. The new SPHERE data show the disk around SU Aur and extended dust structures in unprecedented detail. We resolve several dust tails connected to the Keplerian disk. By comparison with ALMA data, we show that these dust tails represent material falling onto the disk. The disk itself shows an intricate spiral structure and a shadow lane, cast by an inner, misaligned disk component. Our observations suggest that SU Aur is undergoing late infall of material, which can explain the observed disk structures. SU Aur is the clearest observational example of this mechanism at work and demonstrates that late accretion events can still occur in the class II phase, thereby significantly affecting the evolution of circumstellar disks. Constraining the frequency of such events with additional observations will help determine whether this process is responsible for the spin–orbit misalignment in evolved exoplanet systems.},

This system is unique among discovered systems in that it contains an asymmetrical debris disk, as well as an 11 M Jup planet companion, at a separation of ∼735 au. Only a handful of other systems are known to contain both a disk and a directly imaged planet, where HD 106906 is the only one in which the planet has apparently been scattered. The debris disk is nearly edge-on and extends to roughly {\textgreater}500 au, where previous studies with the Hubble Space Telescope have shown the outer regions to have high asymmetry. To better understand the structure and composition of the disk, we have performed a deep polarimetric study of HD 106906's asymmetrical debris disk using newly obtained H-, J-, and K1-band polarimetric data from the Gemini Planet Imager. An empirical analysis of our data supports a disk that is asymmetrical in surface brightness and structure, where fitting an inclined ring model to the disk spine suggests that the disk may be highly eccentric (e ≳ 0.16). A comparison of the disk flux with the stellar flux in each band suggests a blue color that also does not significantly vary across the disk. We discuss these results in terms of possible sources of asymmetry, where we find that dynamical interaction with the planet companion, HD 106906b, is a likely candidate.},

(2019, A\&A, 626, A54).. We calculate quadrant parameters for simple models of rotationally symmetric and optically thin debris disks and the results provide diagnostic diagrams for the determination of the scattering asymmetry of the dust. This method is tested with data for HR 4796A and compared with detailed scattering phase curve extractions in the literature.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The parameters {\textless}i{\textgreater}Q{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}xxx{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}U{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}xxx{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} are ideal for a well-defined and simple characterization of the azimuthal dependence of the polarized light from circumstellar disk because they are based on the “natural” Stokes {\textless}i{\textgreater}Q{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}U{\textless}i/{\textgreater} quadrant pattern produced by circumstellar scattering. For optically thin and rotationally symmetric debris disks the quadrant parameters normalized to the integrated azimuthal polarization {\textless}i{\textgreater}Q{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}xxx{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}∕{\textless}i{\textgreater}Q{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}ϕ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}U{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}xxx{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}∕{\textless}i{\textgreater}Q{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}ϕ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} or quadrant ratios like {\textless}i{\textgreater}Q{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}000{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}∕{\textless}i{\textgreater}Q{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}180{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} depend only on the disk inclination {\textless}i{\textgreater}i{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and the polarized scattering phase function {\textless}i{\textgreater}f{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}ϕ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}θ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) of the dust, and they do not depend on the radial distribution of the scattering emissivity. Because the disk inclination {\textless}i{\textgreater}i{\textless}i/{\textgreater} is usually well known for resolved observations, we can derive the shape of {\textless}i{\textgreater}f{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}ϕ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}θ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) for the phase angle range {\textless}i{\textgreater}θ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} sampled by the polarization quadrants. This finding also applies to models with vertical extensions as observed for debris disks. Diagnostic diagrams are calculated for all normalized quadrant parameters and several quadrant ratios for the determination of the asymmetry parameter {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}i/{\textgreater} of the polarized Henyey-Greenstein scattering phase function {\textless}i{\textgreater}f{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}ϕ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}θ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}i/{\textgreater}). We apply these diagrams to the measurement of HR 4796A, and find that a phase function with only one parameter does not reproduce the data well. We find a better solution with a three-parameter phase function {\textless}i{\textgreater}f{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}ϕ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}θ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}w{\textless}i/{\textgreater}), but it is also noted that the well-observed complex disk of HR 4796A cannot be described in full detail with the simple quadrant polarization parameters.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The described quadrant polarization parameters are very useful for quantifying the azimuthal dependence of the scattering polarization of spatially resolved circumstellar disks illuminated by the central star. They provide a simple test of the deviations of the disk geometry from axisymmetry and can be used to constrain the scattering phase function for optically thin disks without detailed model fitting of disk images. The parameters are easy to derive from observations and model calculations and are therefore well suited to systematic studies of the dust scattering in circumstellar disks.},

	abstract = {We observed the nearly edge-on debris disk system HD 111520 at the HJ and K1 near-infrared (NIR) bands using both the spectral and polarization modes of the Gemini Planet Imager. With these new observations, we have performed an empirical analysis in order to better understand the disk morphology and its highly asymmetrical nature. We find that the disk features a large brightness and radial asymmetry, most prominent at shorter wavelengths. We also find that the radial location of the peak polarized intensity differs on either side of the star by 11 au, suggesting that the disk may be eccentric, although, such an eccentricity does not fully explain the large brightness and radial asymmetry observed. Observations of the disk halo with the Hubble Space Telescope also show the disk to be warped at larger separations, with a bifurcation feature in the northwest, further suggesting that there may be a planet in this system creating an asymmetrical disk structure. Measuring the disk color shows that the brighter extension is bluer compared to the dimmer extension, suggesting that the two sides have different dust grain properties. This finding, along with the large brightness asymmetry, are consistent with the hypothesis that a giant impact occurred between two large bodies in the northern extension of the disk, although confirming this based on NIR observations alone is not feasible. Follow-up imaging with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array to resolve the asymmetry in the dust mass distribution is essential in order to confirm this scenario.},

The data reveal darkening effects on the ring and spiral, although we do not identify the origin of each feature such as shadows or physical features related to the outer spirals. Geometric albedos converted from the surface brightness suggest a greater scale height and/or prominently abundant submicron dust at position angles between ∼45° and 90°. Spiral fitting resulted in very large pitch angles (∼30°–50°); a stellar flyby of HD 34700 B or infall from a possible envelope is perhaps a reasonable scenario to explain the large pitch angles.},

	abstract = {Context. High-contrast scattered light observations have revealed the surface morphology of several dozen protoplanetary disks at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Inclined disks offer the opportunity to measure part of the phase function of the dust grains that reside in the disk surface which is essential for our understanding of protoplanetary dust properties and the early stages of planet formation. Aims: We aim to construct a method which takes into account how the flaring shape of the scattering surface of an optically thick protoplanetary disk projects onto the image plane of the observer. This allows us to map physical quantities (e.g., scattering radius and scattering angle) onto scattered light images and retrieve stellar irradiation corrected images (r2-scaled) and dust phase functions. Methods: The scattered light mapping method projects a power law shaped disk surface onto the detector plane after which the observed scattered light image is interpolated backward onto the disk surface. We apply the method on archival polarized intensity images of the protoplanetary disk around HD 100546 that were obtained with VLT/SPHERE in the R' band and VLT/NACO in the H and Ks bands. Results: The brightest side of the r2-scaled R' band polarized intensity image of HD 100546 changes from the far to the near side of the disk when a flaring instead of a geometrically flat disk surface is used for the r2-scaling. The decrease in polarized surface brightness in the scattering angle range of 40°-70° is likely a result of the dust phase function and degree of polarization which peak in different scattering angle regimes. The derived phase functions show part of a forward scattering peak, which indicates that large, aggregate dust grains dominate the scattering opacity in the disk surface. Conclusions: Projection effects of a protoplanetary disk surface need to be taken into account to correctly interpret scattered light images. Applying the correct scaling for the correction of stellar irradiation is crucial for the interpretation of the images and the derivation of the dust properties in the disk surface layer.},

For characterization, CHARIS has a high-resolution prism providing an average spectral resolution of R82, R69, and R82 in J, H, and K bands respectively. The so-called discovery mode uses a second low-resolution prism with an average spectral resolution of R19 spanning 1.15-2.37 microns (J+H+K bands). This is unique compared to other high contrast IFS designs. It augments low inner working angle performance by reducing the separation at which we can rely on spectral differential imaging. The principal challenge for a high-contrast IFS is quasi-static speckles, which cause undue levels of spectral crosstalk. CHARIS has addressed this through several key design aspects that should constrain crosstalk between adjacent spectral features to be below 1\%. Sitting on the Nasmyth platform, the alignment between the lenslet array, prism, and detector will be highly stable, key for the performance of the data pipeline. Nearly every component has arrived and the project is entering its final build phase.

	abstract = {Context.
              In recent years, our understanding of giant planet formation progressed substantially. There have even been detections of a few young protoplanet candidates still embedded in the circumstellar disks of their host stars. The exact physics that describes the accretion of material from the circumstellar disk onto the suspected circumplanetary disk and eventually onto the young, forming planet is still an open question.
            
            
              Aims.
              We seek to detect and quantify observables related to accretion processes occurring locally in circumstellar disks, which could be attributed to young forming planets. We focus on objects known to host protoplanet candidates and/or disk structures thought to be the result of interactions with planets.
            
            
              Methods.
              We analyzed observations of six young stars (age 3.5–10 Myr) and their surrounding environments with the SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in the H
              α
              filter (656 nm) and a nearby continuum filter (644.9 nm). We applied several point spread function (PSF) subtraction techniques to reach the highest possible contrast near the primary star, specifically investigating regions where forming companions were claimed or have been suggested based on observed disk morphology.
            
            
              Results.

The images reveal an arc-like region of scattered light from the disc surface layers that is likely associated with the first bright ring detected with ALMA in the λ = 1.3 mm dust continuum at ∼65 au. We also detect a point-like source at ∼0.5 arcsec projected separation in the north-east direction, close to the inner edge of the second gap in the millimetre images. Comparing the point source photometry with the atmospheric emission models of non-accreting giant planets, we obtain a mass of 6-7 MJ for a putative protoplanet, assuming a system age of 5 Myr. Based on the contrast at a 95 per cent level of completeness calculated on the emission-free regions of our images, we set upper limits for the masses of giant planets of 8-15 MJ, 4.5-6.5 MJ, and 2.5-4.0 MJ at the locations of the first, second, and third gap in the millimetre dust continuum, respectively. Further deep, high-resolution thermal IR imaging of the HD 163296 system are warranted to confirm the presence and nature of the point source and to better understand the structure of the dust disc.},

	abstract = {Context. HR 4796 A is surrounded by a debris disc, observed in scattered light as an inclined ring with a high surface brightness. Past observations have raised several questions. First, a strong brightness asymmetry detected in polarised reflected light has recently challenged our understanding of scattering by the dust particles in this system. Secondly, the morphology of the ring strongly suggests the presence of planets, although no planets have been detected to date. Aims: We aim here at measuring with high accuracy the morphology and photometry of the ring in scattered light, in order to derive the phase function of the dust and constrain its near-infrared spectral properties. We also want to constrain the presence of planets and set improved constraints on the origin of the observed ring morphology. Methods: We obtained high-angular resolution coronagraphic images of the circumstellar environment around HR 4796 A with VLT/SPHERE during the commissioning of the instrument in May 2014 and during guaranteed-time observations in February 2015. The observations reveal for the first time the entire ring of dust, including the semi-minor axis that was previously hidden either behind the coronagraphic spot or in the speckle noise. Results: We determine empirically the scattering phase function of the dust in the H band from 13.6° to 166.6°. It shows a prominent peak of forward scattering, never detected before, for scattering angles below 30°. We analyse the reflectance spectra of the disc from the 0.95 μm to 1.6 μm, confirming the red colour of the dust, and derive detection limits on the presence of planetary mass objects. Conclusions: We confirm which side of the disc is inclined towards the Earth. The analysis of the phase function, especially below 45°, suggests that the dust population is dominated by particles much larger than the observation wavelength, of about 20 μm. Compact Mie grains of this size are incompatible with the spectral energy distribution of the disc, however the observed rise in scattering efficiency beyond 50° points towards aggregates which could reconcile both observables. We do not detect companions orbiting the star, but our high-contrast observations provide the most stringent constraints yet on the presence of planets responsible for the morphology of the dust.},

While nearly 1,900 exoplanets have now been discovered and confirmed, none are still in the process of formation. Transition disks, protoplanetary disks with inner clearings best explained by the influence of accreting planets, are natural laboratories for the study of planet formation. Some transition disks show evidence for the presence of young planets in the form of disk asymmetries or infrared sources detected within their clearings, as in the case of LkCa 15 (refs 8, 9). Attempts to observe directly signatures of accretion onto protoplanets have hitherto proven unsuccessful. Here we report adaptive optics observations of LkCa 15 that probe within the disk clearing. With accurate source positions over multiple epochs spanning 2009-2015, we infer the presence of multiple companions on Keplerian orbits. We directly detect Hα emission from the innermost companion, LkCa 15 b, evincing hot (about 10,000 kelvin) gas falling deep into the potential well of an accreting protoplanet.},

These statistics can be probed by any MEC observation due to the photon-counting capabilities of MKID detectors. Photon arrival time statistics can also be used to directly distinguish companions from speckles using a post-processing technique called Stochastic Speckle Discrimination (SSD). Here, we give an overview of the SSD technique and highlight the first demonstration of SSD on an extended source-the protoplanetary disk AB Aurigae. We then present simulations that provide an in-depth exploration as to the current limitations of an extension of the SSD technique called Photon-Counting SSD (PCSSD) to provide a path forward for transitioning PCSSD from simulations to on-sky results. We end with a discussion of how to further improve the efficacy of such arrival-time-based post-processing techniques applicable to both MKIDs, as well as other high-speed astronomical cameras. * Based in part on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.},

Accretion tracers in the planetary-mass regime could originate from the shock itself, making them particularly susceptible to extinction by the accreting material. High-resolution (R \&gt; 50 000) spectrographs operating at H α should soon enable one to study how the incoming material shapes the line profile. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We calculate how much the gas and dust accreting onto a planet reduce the H α flux from the shock at the planetary surface and how they affect the line shape. We also study the absorption-modified relationship between the H α luminosity and accretion rate. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We computed the high-resolution radiative transfer of the H α line using a one-dimensional velocity-density-temperature structure for the inflowing matter in three representative accretion geometries: spherical symmetry, polar inflow, and magnetospheric accretion. For each, we explored the wide relevant ranges of the accretion rate and planet mass. We used detailed gas opacities and carefully estimated possible dust opacities. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: At accretion rates of Ṁ ≲ 3 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, gas extinction is negligible for spherical or polar inflow and at most A{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H α{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≲ 0.5 mag for magnetospheric accretion.

We identify this second Hα peak as a second protoplanet in the PDS 70 system.

Our results can be compared with individual directly imaged extrasolar (proto)planets and with statistical results from surveys. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We calculated three populations of synthetic planets assuming different efficiencies of the accretional heating by gas and planetesimals during formation. We describe the temporal evolution of the planetary mass-luminosity relation. We investigate the relative importance of the shock and internal luminosity during formation, and predict a statistical version of the post-formation mass vs. entropy "tuning fork" diagram. Because the calculations now include deuterium burning we also update the planetary mass-radius relationship in time. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find significant overlap between the high post-formation luminosities of planets forming with hot and cold gas accretion because of the core-mass effect. Variations in the individual formation histories of planets can still lead to a factor 5 to 20 spread in the post-formation luminosity at a given mass. However, if the gas accretional heating and planetesimal accretion rate during the runaway phase is unknown, the post-formation luminosity may exhibit a spread of as much as 2-3 orders of magnitude at a fixed mass. As a key result we predict a flat log-luminosity distribution for giant planets, and a steep increase towards lower luminosities due to the higher occurrence rate of low-mass (M ≲ 10-40 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) planets. Future surveys may detect this upturn. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our results indicate that during formation an estimation of the planetary mass may be possible for cold gas accretion if the planetary gas accretion rate can be estimated. If it is unknown whether the planet still accretes gas, the spread in total luminosity (internal + accretional) at a given mass may be as large as two orders of magnitude, therefore inhibiting the mass estimation. Due to the core-mass effect even planets which underwent cold accretion can have large post-formation entropies and luminosities, such that alternative formation scenarios such as gravitational instabilities do not need to be invoked. Once the number of self-luminous exoplanets with known ages and luminosities increases, the resulting luminosity distributions may be compared with our predictions.},

Also detected is a distinct set of emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and , which are commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. We model the observed dust IR spectral energy distribution (SED) and PAH emission features of the HD 34700 disk in terms of porous dust and astronomical-PAHs. Porous dust together with a mixture of neutral and ionized PAHs closely explains the dust IR SED and PAH emission features observed in the HD 34700 disk. Due to the stellar radiation pressure and Poynting–Robertson drag together with the photodissociation of PAHs, substantial removal of dust and PAHs has occurred in the disk, and continuous replenishment of these materials is required to maintain their current abundances. This implies that these materials are not primitive but secondary products probably originating from mutual collisions among planetesimals, asteroids, and comets.},

Furthermore, we resolve the inner disk for the first time and trace it out to 30 AU. This new source of scattered light may contribute to the near-infrared interferometric signal attributed to the protoplanet candidate LkCa 15 b, which lies embedded in the outer regions of the inner disk.

With polarimetry and photometry based on reference star differential imaging (RDI), we were able to measure the linearly polarized intensity and the total intensity of the light scattered by the circumstellar disk with high precision. We used simple Monte Carlo simulations of multiple light scattering by the disk surface to derive constraints for three scattering parameters of the dust: the maximum polarization of the scattered light P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}max{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, the asymmetry parameter g, and the single-scattering albedo ω. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We measure a reflected total intensity of 51.4 ± 1.5 mJy and 206 ± 12 mJy and a polarized intensity of 11.3 ± 0.3 mJy and 55.1 ± 3.3 mJy in the VBB and H-band, respectively. We also find in the visual range a degree of polarization that varies between 28\% on the far side of the disk and 17\% on the near side. In the H-band, the degree of polarization is consistently higher by about a factor of 1.2. The disk also shows a red color for the scattered light intensity and the polarized intensity, which are about twice as high in the near-infrared when compared to the visual. We determine with model calculations the scattering properties of the dust particles and find evidence for strong forward scattering (g ≈ 0.5-0.75), relatively low single-scattering albedo (ω ≈ 0.2-0.5), and high maximum polarization (P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}max{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≈ 0.5-0.75) at the surface on the far side of the disk for both observed wavelengths. The optical parameters indicate the presence of large aggregate dust particles, which are necessary to explain the high maximum polarization, the strong forward-scattering nature of the dust, and the observed red disk color. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The reduced Q{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ϕ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} images given in Fig. 2 and the corresponding U{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ϕ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} images in VBB and H-band are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/648/A110"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/648/A110{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Context. Near-IR polarimetric images of protoplanetary disks enable us to characterize substructures that might be due to the interaction with (forming) planets. The available census is strongly biased toward massive disks around old stars, however. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: The DARTTS program aims at alleviating this bias by imaging a large number of T Tauri stars with diverse properties. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: DARTTS-S employs VLT/SPHERE to image the polarized scattered light from disks. In parallel, DARTTS-A provides ALMA images of the same targets for a comparison of different dust components. In this work, we present new SPHERE images of 21 circumstellar disks, which is the largest sample released to date. We also recalculated some relevant stellar and disk properties following Gaia DR2. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The targets of this work are significantly younger than those published thus far with polarimetric near-IR (NIR) imaging. Scattered light is unambiguously resolved in 11 targets, and some polarized unresolved signal is detected in 3 additional sources. Some disk substructures are detected. However, the paucity of spirals and shadows from this sample reinforces the trend according to which these NIR features are associated with Herbig stars, either because they are older or more massive. Furthermore, disk rings that are apparent in ALMA observations of some targets do not appear to have corresponding detections with SPHERE. Inner cavities larger than {\textasciitilde}15 au are also absent from our images, even though they are expected from the spectral energy distribution. On the other hand, 3 objects show extended filaments at larger scale that are indicative of strong interaction with the surrounding medium. All but one of the undetected disks are best explained by their limited size (≲20 au), and the high occurrence of stellar companions in these sources suggests an important role in limiting the disk size. One undetected disk is massive and very large at millimeter wavelengths, implying that it is self-shadowed in the NIR. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: This work paves the way toward a more complete and less biased sample of scattered-light observations, which is required to interpret how disk features evolve throughout the disk lifetime. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The reduced images are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/633/A82"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/633/A82{\textless}/A{\textgreater} {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations performed with VLT/SPHERE under program 098.C-0486(A).},

	abstract = {Context. In recent years, a new hot topic has emerged in the star and planet formation field, namely, the interaction between the circumstellar disk and its birth cloud. The birth environments of young stars leave strong imprints on the star itself and their surroundings. In this context, we present a detailed analysis of the rich circumstellar environment around the young Herbig Ae/Be star T CrA. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Our aim is to understand the nature of the stellar system and the extended circumstellar structures, as seen in scattered light images. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We conducted our analysis on the basis of a set of combined archival data and new adaptive optics images at a high contrast and high resolution. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The scattered light images reveal the presence of a complex environment around T CrA, composed of a bright, forward-scattering rim of the disk's surface that is seen at very high inclinations, along with a dark lane of the disk midplane, bipolar outflows, and streamer features that are likely tracing infalling material from the surrounding birth cloud onto the disk. The analysis of the light curve suggests that the star is a binary with a period of 29.6 yr, confirming previous assertions based on spectro-astrometry. The comparison of the scattered light images with the ALMA continuum and {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}12{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}CO (2-1) line emission shows that the disk is in Keplerian rotation and the northern side of the outflowing material is receding, while the southern side is approaching the observer. The overall system lies on different geometrical planes. The orbit of the binary star is perpendicular to the outflows and is seen edge on. The disk is itself seen edge-on, with a position angle of {\textasciitilde}7°. The direction of the outflows seen in scattered light is in agreement with the direction of the more distant molecular hydrogen emission-line objects (MHOs) associated with the star. Modeling of the spectral energy distribution using a radiative transfer scheme is in good agreement with the proposed configuration, as well as the hydrodynamical simulation performed using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We find evidence of streamers of accreting material around T CrA. These streamers connect the filament, along which T CrA is forming along with the outer parts of the disk, suggesting that the strong misalignment between the inner and outer disk is due to a change in the direction of the angular momentum of the material accreting on the disk during the late phase of star formation. This impacts the accretion taking place in the components of the binary, favoring the growth of the primary with respect the secondary, in contrast to the case of aligned disks. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Reduced images are also available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/"{\textgreater}cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/671/A82"{\textgreater}https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/671/A82{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Circumstellar disks do not evolve in isolation, as about half of solar-type stars were born in binary or multiple systems. Resolving disks in binary systems provides the opportunity to examine the influence of stellar companions on the outcomes of planet formation. We aim to investigate and compare disks in stellar multiple systems with near-infrared scattered-light imaging as part of the Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars (DESTINYS) program. We used polarimetric differential imaging with SPHERE/IRDIS at the VLT to search for scattered light from the circumstellar disks in three multiple systems, CHX 22, S CrA, and HP Cha. We performed astrometric and orbit analyses for the stellar companions using archival HST, VLT/NACO, and SPHERE data. Combined with the age and orbital constraints, the observed disk structures provide insights into the evolutionary history and the impact of the stellar companions. The small grains in CHX 22 form a tail-like structure surrounding the close binary, which likely results from a close encounter and capture of a cloudlet. S CrA shows intricate structures (tentative ringed and spiral features) in the circumprimary disk as a possible consequence of perturbations by companions. The circumsecondary disk is truncated and connected to the primary disk via a streamer, suggesting tidal interactions. In HP Cha, the primary disk is less disturbed and features a tenuous streamer, through which the material flows towards the companions. The comparison of the three systems spans a wide range of binary separation (50 - 500 au) and illustrates the decreasing influence on disk structures with the distance of companions. This agrees with the statistical analysis of exoplanet population in binaries, that planet formation is likely obstructed around close binary systems, while it is not suppressed in wide binaries.},

	abstract = {Context. Disk winds are an important mechanism for accretion and disk evolution around young stars. The accreting intermediate-mass T-Tauri star RY Tau has an active jet and a previously known disk wind. Archival optical and new near-infrared observations of the RY Tau system show two horn-like components stretching out as a cone from RY Tau. Scattered light from the disk around RY Tau is visible in the near-infrared, but not seen at optical wavelengths. In the near-infrared, dark wedges separate the horns from the disk, indicating that we may see the scattered light from a disk wind. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to test the hypothesis that a dusty disk wind could be responsible for the optical effect in which the disk around RY Tau is hidden in the I band, but visible in the H band. This could be the first detection of a dusty disk wind in scattered light. We also want to constrain the grain size and dust mass in the wind and the wind-launching region. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We used archived Atacama-Large-Millimetre-Array (ALMA) and Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE) I band observations combined with newly acquired SPHERE H band observations and available literature to build a simple geometric model of the RY Tau disk and disk wind. We used Monte Carlo radiative transfer modelling MCMax3D to create comparable synthetic observations that test the effect of a dusty wind on the optical effect in the observations. We constrained the grain size and dust mass needed in the disk wind to reproduce the effect from the observations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: A model geometrically reminiscent of a dusty disk wind with small micron to sub-micron-sized grains elevated above the disk can reproduce the optical effect seen in the observations.

DO Tau is a T Tauri star that has previously been hypothesized to have undergone a close encounter with the HV Tau system. As part of the DESTINYS ESO Large Programme, we present new Very Large Telescope (VLT)/SPHERE polarimetric observations of DO Tau and combine them with archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) scattered-light images and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of CO isotopologues and CS to map a network of complex structures. The SPHERE and ALMA observations show that the circumstellar disk is connected to arms extending out to several hundred astronomical units. HST and ALMA also reveal stream-like structures northeast of DO Tau, some of which are at least several thousand astronomical units long. These streams appear not to be gravitationally bound to DO Tau, and comparisons with previous Herschel far-IR observations suggest that the streams are part of a bridge-like structure connecting DO Tau and HV Tau. We also detect a fainter redshifted counterpart to a previously known blueshifted CO outflow. While some of DO Tau's complex structures could be attributed to a recent disk-disk encounter, they might be explained alternatively by interactions with remnant material from the star formation process. These panchromatic observations of DO Tau highlight the need to contextualize the evolution of Class II disks by examining processes occurring over a wide range of size scales.},

	abstract = {Context. To understand the formation of planetary systems, it is important to understand the initial conditions of planet formation, that is, the young gas-rich planet forming disks. Spatially resolved, high-contrast observations are of particular interest since substructures in disks that are linked to planet formation can be detected. In addition, we have the opportunity to reveal close companions or even planets in formation that are embedded in the disk. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: In this study, we present the first results of the Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars (DESTINYS), an ESO/SPHERE large program that is aimed at studying disk evolution in scattered light, mainly focusing on a sample of low-mass stars (\&lt; 1 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) in nearby (∼200 pc) star-forming regions. In this particular study, we present observations of the ET Cha (RECX 15) system, a nearby "old" classical T Tauri star (5-8 Myr, ∼100 pc), which is still strongly accreting. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We used SPHERE/IRDIS in the H-band polarimetric imaging mode to obtain high spatial resolution and high-contrast images of the ET Cha system to search for scattered light from the circumstellar disk as well as thermal emission from close companions. We additionally employed VLT/NACO total intensity archival data of the system taken in 2003. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Here, we report the discovery, using SPHERE/IRDIS, of a low-mass (sub)stellar companion to the η Cha cluster member ET Cha. We estimate the mass of this new companion based on photometry. Depending on the system age, it is either a 5 Myr, 50 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} brown dwarf or an 8 Myr, 0.10 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} M-type, pre-main-sequence star. We explore possible orbital solutions and discuss the recent dynamic history of the system. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Independent of the precise companion mass, we find that the presence of the companion likely explains the small size of the disk around ET Cha. The small separation of the binary pair indicates that the disk around the primary component is likely clearing from the outside in, which explains the high accretion rate of the system. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on data obtained in ESO programs 1104.C-0415(E) and 70.C-0286(A).},

	abstract = {In this chapter of the Protostars and Planets VII, we review the breakthrough progress that has been made in the field of high-resolution, high-contrast optical and near-infrared imaging of planet-forming disks. These advancements include the direct detection of protoplanets embedded in some disks, and derived limits on planetary masses in others. Morphological substructures, including: rings, spirals, arcs, and shadows, are seen in all imaged infrared-bright disks to date, and are ubiquitous across spectral types. These substructures are believed to be the result of disk evolution processes, and in particular disk-planet interactions. Since small dust grains that scatter light are tightly bound to the disk's gas, these observations closely trace disk structures predicted by hydrodynamical models and serve as observational tests of the predictions of planet formation theories. We argue that the results of current and next-generation high-contrast imaging surveys will, when combined with complementary data from ALMA, lead to a much deeper understanding of the co-evolution of disks and planets, and the mechanisms by which planets form.},

	abstract = {Sirius has always attracted a lot of scientific interest, especially after the discovery of a companion white dwarf at the end of the 19th century. Very early on, the existence of a potential third body was put forward to explain some of the observed properties of the system. We present new coronagraphic observations obtained with VLT/SPHERE (Very Large Telescope/Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch) that explore, for the very first time, the innermost regions of the system down to 0.2 arcsec(0.5 au) from Sirius A. Our observations cover the near-infrared from 0.95 to 2.3 μm and they offer the best on-sky contrast ever reached at these angular separations. After detailing the steps of our SPHERE/IRDIFS data analysis, we present a robust method to derive detection limits for multispectral data from high-contrast imagers and spectrographs. In terms of raw performance, we report contrasts of 14.3 mag at 0.2 arcsec, ∼16.3 mag in the 0.4-1.0 arcsec range and down to 19 mag at 3.7 arcsec. In physical units, our observations are sensitive to giant planets down to 11 MJup at 0.5 au, 6-7 MJup in the 1-2 au range and ∼4 MJup at 10 au. Despite the exceptional sensitivity of our observations, we do not report the detection of additional companions around Sirius A. Using a Monte Carlo orbital analysis, we show that we can reject, with about 50 per cent probability, the existence of an 8 MJup planet orbiting at 1 au.},

	abstract = {New numerical simulations of the formation of the giant planets are presented, in which for the first time both the gas and planetesimal accretion rates are calculated in a self-consistent, interactive fashion. The simulations combine three elements: (1) three-body accretion cross sections of solids onto an isolated planetary embryo, (2) a stellar evolution code for the planet's gaseous envelope, and (3) a planetesimal dissolution code within the envelope, used to evaluate the planet's effective capture radius and the energy deposition profile of accreted material. Major assumptions include: The planet is embedded in a disk of gas and small planetesimals with locally uniform initial surface mass density, and planetesimals are not allowed to migrate into or out of the planet's feeding zone. All simulations are characterized by three major phases. During the first phase, the planet's mass consists primarily of solid material. The planetesimal accretion rate, which dominates that of gas, rapidly increases owing to runaway accretion, then decreases as the planet's feeding zone is depleted. During the second phase, both solid and gas accretion rates are small and nearly independent of time. The third phase, marked by runaway gas accretion, starts when the solid and gas masses are about equal. It is engendered by a strong positive feedback on the gas accretion rates, driven by the rapid contraction of the gaseous envelope and the rapid expansion of the outer boundary, which depends on the planet's total mass. The overall evolutionary time scale is generally determined by the length of the second phase. The actual rates at which the giant planets accreted small planetesimals is probably intermediate between the constant rates assumed in most previous studies and the highly variable rates used here. Within the context of the adopted model of planetesimal accretion, the joint constraints of the time scale for dissipation of the solar nebula and the current high-Zmasses of the giant planets lead to estimates of the initial surface density (σinit) of planetesimals in the outer region of the solar nebula. The results show that σinit≈ 10 g cm-2near Jupiter's orbit and that σinit∝a-2, whereais the distance from the Sun. These values are a factor of 3 to 4 times as high as that of the "minimum-mass" solar nebula at Jupiter's distance and a factor of 2 to 3 times as high at Saturn's distance. The estimates for the formation time of Jupiter and Saturn are 1 to 10 million years, whereas those for Uranus fall in the range 2 to 16 million years. These estimates follow from the properties of our Solar System and do not necessarily apply to giant planets in other planetary systems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07189},
	abstract = {The discovery of the exoplanet Proxima b highlights the potential for the coming generation of giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs) to characterize terrestrial --- potentially habitable --- planets orbiting nearby stars with direct imaging. This will require continued development and implementation of optimized adaptive optics systems feeding coronagraphs on the GSMTs. Such development should proceed with an understanding of the fundamental limits imposed by atmospheric turbulence. Here we seek to address this question with a semi-analytic framework for calculating the post-coronagraph contrast in a closed-loop AO system. We do this starting with the temporal power spectra of the Fourier basis calculated assuming frozen flow turbulence, and then apply closed-loop transfer functions. We include the benefits of a simple predictive controller, which we show could provide over a factor of 1400 gain in raw PSF contrast at 1 \${\textbackslash}lambda/D\$ on bright stars, and more than a factor of 30 gain on an I = 7.5 mag star such as Proxima. More sophisticated predictive control can be expected to improve this even further. Assuming a photon noise limited observing technique such as High Dispersion Coronagraphy, these gains in raw contrast will decrease integration times by the same large factors. Predictive control of atmospheric turbulence should therefore be seen as one of the key technologies which will enable ground-based telescopes to characterize terrrestrial planets.},

	abstract = {Context. The abundances of elements in the atmosphere of an individual star provide a very broad range of extremely important information about the formation and evolution history of that star. Specifically, during the main sequence phase, the abundance pattern observed can provide valuable constraints on a range of hydrodynamical processes occurring beneath the visible atmosphere. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Among middle main sequence (A and B) stars, it is unusual to have abundance determinations for more than about a dozen of the 30 lightest chemical elements, largely because many elements do not have usefully strong spectral lines in the visible wavelength window usually used for abundance analysis. Exceptionally, for the bright, sharp-lined hot Am star Sirius A = HD 48915, high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio observations of the spectrum are available from 1265 Å to about 1 μm. The aim of this project is to determine generally how useful the UV part of the spectrum is for "generic" abundance determination in A stars, and which abundances of light and iron peak elements can be determined or improved for Sirius A using this nearly unique data set. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The UV and visible spectrum of Sirius A has been searched for useful spectral lines of all elements up to nickel (2 ≤ Z ≤ 28), as well as the heavy elements Sr, Y, Zr and Ba. Using the spectrum synthesis code ZEEMAN, abundances or upper limits are derived. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Abundances relative to H have been determined for a total of 20 elements, and upper limits are found for 4 others. Useful measurements or limits are possible from these data for all but three of the elements through Ni. In particular, it is found that the light element B is underabundant relative to the Sun by a factor of at least 30. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Recent computations have led to predictions of the abundance pattern of almost all the elements having Z ≤ 28 expected in the atmosphere of Sirius as a result of competition between (1) gravitationally and radiatively driven diffusion and either (2) turbulent mixing or (3) homogeneous mass loss. Comparison of these predictions with observations has been hampered by the limited number of elements for which accurate abundance determinations are available. The work presented here increases the number of elements for which reasonably well-determined abundances are available, and establishes more clearly the uncertainty of the abundance values for most of the elements up to Ni. The new data provide useful tests of the theoretical predictions of the consequences of atomic diffusion in slowly rotating A stars, and in some cases contradict them. These data may also provide some fresh insight into the evolution of the Sirius system. It appears that the new abundance values may be qualitatively consistent with the possibility that significant mass transfer has occurred between the two components of the system during its evolution.},

	abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter and Submillimeter Array observations of the protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 that trace the spatial distribution of millimeter-sized particles and cold molecular gas on spatial scales as small as 25 astronomical units (A.U.). The image of the disk recorded in the 1.3 mm continuum emission reveals three dark concentric rings that indicate the presence of dust depleted gaps at about 60, 100, and 160 A.U. from the central star. The maps of the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O J=2−1 emission do not show such structures but reveal a change in the slope of the radial intensity profile across the positions of the dark rings in the continuum image. By comparing the observations with theoretical models for the disk emission, we find that the density of CO molecules is reduced inside the middle and outer dust gaps. However, in the inner ring there is no evidence of CO depletion. From the measurements of the dust and gas densities, we deduce that the gas-to-dust ratio varies across the disk and, in particular, it increases by at least a factor 5 within the inner dust gap compared to adjacent regions of the disk. The depletion of both dust and gas suggests that the middle and outer rings could be due to the gravitational torque exerted by two Saturn-mass planets orbiting at 100 and 160 A.U. from the star. On the other hand, the inner dust gap could result from dust accumulation at the edge of a magnetorotational instability dead zone, or from dust opacity variations at the edge of the CO frost line. Observations of the dust emission at higher angular resolution and of molecules that probe dense gas are required to establish more precisely the origins of the dark rings observed in the HD 163296 disk.},

	abstract = {Context. We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia EDR3 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia EDR3 results. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} − G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}RP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) colour are also available. The passbands for G, G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}RP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30-40\% for the parallaxes and by a factor {\textasciitilde}2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}RP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1\% level},

	abstract = {With an aim of getting information on the equatorial rotation velocity (ve) of Sirius A separated from the inclination effect (sin-=i), a detailed profile analysis based on the Fourier transform technique was carried out for a large number of spectral lines, while explicitly taking into account the line-by-line differences in the centre-limb behaviours and the gravity darkening effect (which depend on the physical properties of each line) based on model calculations. The simulations showed that how the first-zero frequencies (q1) of Fourier transform amplitudes depends on ve is essentially determined by the temperature-sensitivity parameter (K) differing from line to line, and that Fe-=I lines (especially those of very weak ones) are more sensitive to ve than Fe-=II lines. The following conclusions were drawn by comparing the theoretical and observed q1 values for many Fe-=I and Fe-=II lines: (1) The projected rotational velocity (vesin-=i) for Sirius A is fairly well established at 16.3(±0.1) km s-1 by requiring that both Fe-=I and Fe-=II lines yield consistent results. (2) Although precise separation of ve and i is difficult, ve is concluded to be in the range of \$16 {\textbackslash}le v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\} {\textbackslash}lesssim\$ 30-40 km s-1, which corresponds to \$25{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \} {\textbackslash}lesssim i {\textbackslash}le 90{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}\$ . Accordingly, Sirius A is an intrinsically slow rotator for an A-type star, being consistent with its surface chemical peculiarity.},

The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the "nested" contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values.

The unprecedented scales of the upcoming ELT-era instruments are inevitably connected with serious challenges for wavefront reconstruction and control algorithms. Apart from the huge number of correcting elements to be controlled in real-time, real-life features such as the segmentation of the telescope pupil, the low wind effect, the nonlinearity of the pyramid sensor, and the noncommon path aberrations will have a significantly larger impact on the imaging quality in the ELT framework than they ever had before. We summarize various kinds of wavefront reconstruction algorithms for the pyramid wavefront sensor. Based on several forward models, different algorithms were developed in the last decades for linear and nonlinear wavefront correction. The core ideas of the algorithms are presented, and a detailed comparison of the presented methods with respect to underlying pyramid sensor models, computational complexities, and reconstruction qualities is given. In addition, we review the existing and possible solutions for the above-named real-life phenomena. At the same time, directions for further investigations are sketched.},

The constructed model is then rescaled with a factor to compensate for the contribution from the disks. We compare NMF with existing methods (classical reference differential imaging method, and the Karhunen-Loève image projection algorithm) using synthetic circumstellar disks and demonstrate the superiority of NMF: with no need of prior selection of references, NMF not only can detect fainter circumstellar disks but also better preserves their morphology and does not require forward modeling. As an application to a well-known disk example, we process the archival Hubble Space Telescope STIS coronagraphic observations of HD 181327 with different methods and compare them, and NMF is able to extract some circumstellar materials inside the primary ring for the first time.

By defining an element which merges values/coefficients with its sampling grid/modal basis into a single object called Field, this minimizes errors in writing the code and makes it clearer to read. HCIPy provides a monochromatic Wavefront and defines a Propagator that acts as the transformation between two wavefronts. In this way a Propagator acts as any physical part of the optical system, be it a piece of free space, a thin complex apodizer or a microlens array. HCIPy contains Fraunhofer and Fresnel propagators through free space. It includes an implementation of a thin complex apodizer, which can modify the phase and/or amplitude of a wavefront, and forms the basis for more complicated optical elements. Included in HCIPy are wavefront errors (modal, power spectra), complex apertures (VLT, Keck or Subaru pupil), coronagraphs (Lyot, vortex or apodizing phase plate coronagraph), deformable mirrors, wavefront sensors (Shack-Hartmann, Pyramid, Zernike or phase-diversity wavefront sensor) and multi-layer atmospheric models including scintillation). HCIPy aims to provide an easy-to-use, modular framework for wavefront control and coronagraphy on current and future telescopes, enabling rapid prototyping of the full high-contrast imaging system. Adaptive optics and coronagraphic systems can be easily extended to include more realistic physics.

As a 3–10 Myr old star, HD 36546 presents a rare opportunity to study a debris disk at very early stages. SCExAO/CHARIS imagery resolves the disk over angular separations of ρ ∼ 0.″25–1.″0 (projected separations of rproj ∼ 25–101 au) and enables the first spectrophotometric analysis of the disk. The disk’s brightness appears symmetric between its eastern and western extents, and it exhibits slightly blue near-infrared colors on average (e.g., J−K = −0.4 ± 0.1)—suggesting copious submicron-sized or highly porous grains. Through detailed modeling adopting a Hong scattering phase function (SPF), instead of the more common Henyey–Greenstein function, and using the differential evolution optimization algorithm, we provide an updated schematic of HD 36546's disk. The disk has a shallow radial dust density profile (α in ≈ 1.0 and α out ≈ −1.5), a fiducial radius of r 0 ≈ 82.7 au, an inclination of i ≈ 79.°1, and a position angle of PA ≈ 80.°1. Through spine tracing, we find a spine that is consistent with our modeling, but also with a “swept-back wing” geometry. Finally, we provide constraints on companions, including limiting a companion responsible for a marginal Hipparcos–Gaia acceleration to a projected separation of ≲0.″2 and to a minimum mass of ≲11 M Jup.},

allowing for coronagraphic direct exoplanet imaging of the inner 3

the operation of SCExAO. A partial correction of low-order modes is
provided by Subaru's facility adaptive optics system with the final
correction, including high-order modes, implemented downstream by a
combination of a visible pyramid wavefront sensor and a 2000-element
deformable mirror. The well corrected NIR (y-K bands) wavefronts can
then be injected into any of the available coronagraphs, including but
not limited to the phase induced amplitude apodization and the vector
vortex coronagraphs, both of which offer an inner working angle as low
as 1 lambda/D. Non-common path, low-order aberrations are sensed with a
coronagraphic low-order wavefront sensor in the infrared (IR). Low
noise, high frame rate, NIR detectors allow for active speckle nulling

It is thus critical to correct for the possible slow drift of the star image from the phase mask center, generally due to mechanical flexures induced by temperature and/or gravity field variation, or to misalignment between the optics that rotate in pupil tracking mode. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: A control loop based on the QACITS algorithm for the vortex coronagraph has been developed and deployed for the Keck/NIRC2 instrument. This algorithm executes the entire observing sequence, including the calibration steps, initial centering of the star on the vortex center, and stabilisation during the acquisition of science frames. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: On-sky data show that the QACITS control loop stabilizes the position of the star image down to 2.4 mas rms at a frequency of about 0.02 Hz. However, the accuracy of the estimator is probably limited by a systematic error due to a misalignment of the Lyot stop with respect to the entrance pupil, estimated to be on the order of 4.5 mas. A method to reduce the amplitude of this bias down to 1 mas is proposed. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The QACITS control loop has been successfully implemented and provides a robust method to center and stabilize the star image on the vortex mask. In addition, QACITS ensures a repeatable pointing quality and significantly improves the observing efficiency compared to manual operations. It is now routinely used for vortex coronagraph observations at Keck/NIRC2, providing contrast and angular resolution capabilities suited for exoplanet and disk imaging.},

	abstract = {Context. High-resolution imaging reveals a large morphological variety of protoplanetary disks. To date, no constraints on their global evolution have been found from this census. An evolutionary classification of disks was proposed based on their IR spectral energy distribution, with the Group I sources showing a prominent cold component ascribed to an earlier stage of evolution than Group II. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Disk evolution can be constrained from the comparison of disks with different properties. A first attempt at disk taxonomy is now possible thanks to the increasing number of high-resolution images of Herbig Ae/Be stars becoming available. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Near-IR images of six Group II disks in scattered light were obtained with VLT/NACO in polarimetric differential imaging, which is the most efficient technique for imaging the light scattered by the disk material close to the stars. We compare the stellar/disk properties of this sample with those of well-studied Group I sources available from the literature. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Three Group II disks are detected. The brightness distribution in the disk of HD 163296 indicates the presence of a persistent ring-like structure with a possible connection with the CO snowline. A rather compact (\&lt;100 AU) disk is detected around HD 142666 and AK Sco. A taxonomic analysis of 17 Herbig Ae/Be sources reveals that the difference between Group I and Group II is due to the presence or absence of a large disk cavity (≳5 AU). There is no evidence supporting the evolution from Group I to Group II. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Group II disks are not evolved versions of the Group I disks. Within the Group II disks, very different geometries exist (both self-shadowed and compact). HD 163296 could be the primordial version of a typical Group I disk. Other Group II disks, like AK Sco and HD 142666, could be smaller counterparts of Group I unable to open cavities as large as those of Group I. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, Chile, under program number 095.C-0658(A).},

	abstract = {Context. Young stars with debris disks are the most promising targets for an exoplanet search because debris indicate a successful formation of planetary bodies. Debris disks can be shaped by planets into ring structures that give valuable indications on the presence and location of planets in the disk. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We performed observations of the Sco-Cen F star HD 117214 to search for planetary companions and to characterize the debris disk structure. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: HD 117214 was observed with the SPHERE subsystems IRDIS, IFS, and ZIMPOL at optical and near-IR wavelengths using angular and polarimetric differential imaging techniques. This provided the first images of scattered light from the debris disk with the highest spatial resolution of 25 mas and an inner working angle \&lt;0.1″. With the observations with IRDIS and IFS we derived detection limits for substellar companions. The geometrical parameters of the detected disk were constrained by fitting 3D models for the scattering of an optically thin dust disk. Investigating the possible origin of the disk gap, we introduced putative planets therein and modeled the planet-disk and planet-planet dynamical interactions. The obtained planetary architectures were compared with the detection limit curves. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The debris disk has an axisymmetric ring structure with a radius of 0.42(±0.01)″ or {\textasciitilde}45 au and an inclination of 71(±2.5)° and exhibits a 0.4″ ({\textasciitilde}40 au) wide inner cavity.

This ratio is similar to the one obtained for the debris disk HIP 79977, indicating that dust radiation properties are similar for these two disks. Inside the disk cavity we achieve high-sensitivity limits on planetary companions with a mass down to {\textasciitilde}4 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} at projected radial separations between 0.2″ and 0.4″.

	abstract = {We present the results of the first extensive mid-infrared (IR) imaging survey of the rho Ophiuchi embedded cluster, performed with the ISOCAM camera on board the ISO satellite. The main rho Ophiuchi molecular cloud L1688, as well as the two secondary clouds L1689N and L1689S, have been completely surveyed for point sources at 6.7 mu m and 14.3 mu m. A total of 425 sources are detected in {\textasciitilde} 0.7 deg{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, including 16 Class I, 123 Class II, and 77 Class III young stellar objects (YSOs). Essentially all of the mid-IR sources coincide with near-IR sources, but a large proportion of them are recognized for the first time as YSOs. Our dual-wavelength survey allows us to identify essentially all the YSOs with IR excess in the embedded cluster down to F{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}nu{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 10-15 mJy. It more than doubles the known population of Class II YSOs and represents the most complete census to date of newly formed stars in the rho Ophiuchi central region. There are, however, reasons to believe that several tens of Class III YSOs remain to be identified below L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}star{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 0.2 L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The mid-IR luminosities of most ( {\textasciitilde} 65\%) Class II objects are consistent with emission from purely passive circumstellar disks. The stellar luminosity function of the complete sample of Class II YSOs is derived with good accuracy down to L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}star{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 0.03 L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. It is basically flat (in logarithmic units) below L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}star{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 2 L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, exhibits a possible local maximum at L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}star{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 1.5 L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and sharply falls off at higher luminosities. A modeling of the luminosity function, using available pre-main sequence tracks and plausible star formation histories, allows us to derive the mass distribution of the Class II YSOs which arguably reflects the initial mass function (IMF) of the embedded cluster. After correction for the presence of unresolved binary systems, we estimate that the IMF in rho Ophiuchi is well described by a two-component power law with a low-mass index of -0.35+/-0.25, a high-mass index of -1.7 (to be compared with the Salpeter value of -1.35), and a break occurring at M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}flat{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.55+/-0.25 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}.

We measured an azimuthal displacement with respect to the counterpart of this feature in the ALMA data, which is consistent with Keplerian motion on a 4 yr baseline.

comparing our results for several orbiting systems with those of various

successfully predict the location of 51 Eri b six months in the future

10 long-period exoplanets and brown dwarfs, all but one of which have

We obtained direct imaging observations and analysed the TESS photometric time series data of this target with a goal to search for planetary companions and to characterise the morphology of the debris disk and the scattering properties of dust particles. HD 114082 was observed with the VLT/SPHERE instrument: the IRDIS camera in the K band together with the IFS in the Y, J and H band using the ADI technique as well as IRDIS in the H band and ZIMPOL in the I\_PRIME band using the PDI technique. The scattered light images were fitted with a 3D model for single scattering in an optically thin dust disk. We performed aperture photometry in order to derive the scattering and polarized phase functions, polarization fraction and spectral scattering albedo for the dust particles in the disk. This method was also used to obtain the reflectance spectrum of the disk to retrieve the disk color and study the dust reflectivity in comparison to the debris disk HD 117214. We also performed the modeling of the HD 114082 light curve measured by TESS using the models for planet transit and stellar activity to put constraints on radius of the detected planet and its orbit. The debris disk appears as an axisymmetric debris belt with a radius of {\textasciitilde}0.37\$"\$ (35 au), inclination of {\textasciitilde}83\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ and a wide inner cavity. Dust particles in HD 114082 have a maximum polarization fraction of {\textasciitilde}17\% and a high reflectivity which results in a spectral scattering albedo of 0.65. The analysis of TESS photometric data reveals a transiting planetary companion to HD 114082 with a radius of \${\textbackslash}sim\$1{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}rm R\_\{J\}\$ on an orbit with a semi-major axis of \$0.7 {\textbackslash}pm 0.4\$ au. Combining different data, we reach deep sensitivity limits in terms of companion masses down to {\textasciitilde}5\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$ at 50 au, and {\textasciitilde}10 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$ at 30 au from the central star.},

Observational evidence for magnetospheric accretion in young Sun-like stars is robust. Here we report the first observational evidence for disk photoevaporation driven by the central star. We acquired high-resolution (R∼ 30,000) spectra of the [Ne ii] 12.81 μm line from seven circumstellar disks using VISIR on Melipal/VLT. We show that the three transition disks in the sample all have [Ne ii] line profiles consistent with those predicted by a photoevaporative flow driven by stellar extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) photons. The ∼6 km s−1 blueshift of the line from the almost face-on disk of TW Hya is clearly inconsistent with emission from a static disk atmosphere and convincingly points to the presence of a photoevaporative wind. We do not detect any [Ne ii] line close to the stellar velocity from the sample of classical optically thick (nontransition) disks. We conclude that most of the spectrally unresolved [Ne ii] emission in these less-evolved systems arises from jets/outflows rather than from the disk. The pattern of the [Ne ii] detections and nondetections suggests that EUV-driven photoevaporation starts only at a later stage in the disk evolution.},

	abstract = {The photometer (ISOPHOT) on the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) has proved to be invaluable for investigating the dust around main sequence stars (both prototypes and candidate Vega-like stars). The long wavelength camera (at 60 and 90 μm) has been used to map the area around the stars to establish whether the dust disk is extended. Low-resolution spectra between 5.8 and 11.6 μm show whether the dust is composed of silicate grains, and whether molecular features are present. The four prototype Vega-like stars (Vega, β Pic, Fomalhaut, ϵ Eri) are studied, as well as eight other stars, which are main sequence stars with cool dust associated with them. We find that the spectra of β Pic, 49 Cet, HD98800, and HD135344 show excess emission from the cool dust around the star, HD144432 and HD139614 show silicate dust emission, HD169142 and HD34700 show emission features from carbon-rich molecules (possibly PAHs, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules), and HD142666 shows emission features from both carbon-rich molecules and silicate dust. Up to 11.6 μm, the emission from Vega, Fomalhaut, and ϵ Eri is dominated by the stellar photosphere. At 60 and 90 μm, the extended dust emission is mapped, and the disk resolved in eight cases. The dust mass in the disks is found to range from around 10−9 to 10−4M⊙. Since several of the stars are younger than the Sun, and the disks have sufficient material of the type found in the Solar System, these disks could be in the early stages of planet formation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10833},
	doi = {10.5802/crphys.133},
	abstract = {Exoplanetary science is a very active field of astronomy nowadays, with questions still opened such as how planetary systems form and evolve (occurrence, process), why such a diversity of exoplanets is observed (mass, radius, orbital parameters, temperature, composition), and what are the interactions between planets, circumstellar disk and their host star. Several complementary methods are used for the detection of exoplanets. Among these, imaging aims at the direct detection of the light reflected, scattered or emitted by exoplanets and circumstellar disks. This allows their spectral and polarimetric characterization. Such imaging remains challenging because of the large luminosity ratio (1e4-1e10\$) and the small angular separation (fraction of an arcsecond) between the star and its environment. Over the past two decades, numerous techniques, including coronagraphy, have been developed to make exoplanet imaging a reality. This review gives a broad overview of the subsystems that make up a coronagraphic instrument for imaging exoplanetary systems. It is especially intended for non-specialists or newcomers in the field. We explain the principle of coronagraphy and propose a formalism to understand their behavior. We discuss the impact of wavefront aberrations on the performance of coronagraphs and how they induce stellar speckles in the scientific image. Finally, we present instrumental and signal processing techniques used for on-sky minimization or a posteriori calibration of these speckles in order to improve the performance of coronagraphs.},

	abstract = {Coronagraph is a powerful instrumentation that can be used to realize direct exoplanet imaging. Because the stars are far brighter than the exoplanets, a very high requirement for extinction is raised to obtain a high contrast imaging. By optimizing the transmittance of the entrance pupil and the Lyot stop in Lyot Coronagraph, a sequential optimization procedure is proposed to obtain even higher contrast imaging. In this manuscript, the usually adopted joint optimization in the existing literatures is divided into two steps, which we call the sequential optimization procedure. First, the entrance pupil is optimized for maximum transmission while the contrast constraint is imposed on the focal plane of the lens behind it. Second, the Lyot stop is optimized for maximum transmission with the contrast constraint imposed on the imaging plane. Compared with the joint optimization procedure, the sequential one can provide additional advantages. In terms of performance, under the same conditions, an IWA(Inner working angle) of 1.53\&lambda;/D can be obtained while the IWA for joint one is 2.01\&lambda;/D. Moreover, the sequential optimization is much faster. Referring to practical applications, the optimum transmittance of Lyot stop in sequential case becomes binary and therefore easy to fabricate. However sequential optimization reduces the throughput approximately 36.81\%, which is a drawback that should be compensated.},

The SCExAO/CHARIS resolves the disk down to ρ ∼ 0"2 (rproj ∼ 10 au), a factor of ∼3-5 smaller than previous recent studies. We derive a disk position angle of PA ∼ 279°4-280°5 and an inclination of i ∼ 85°3-86.2°. While recent SPHERE/IRDIS imagery of the system could suggest a significantly misaligned two-ring disk geometry, CHARIS imagery does not reveal conclusive evidence for this hypothesis. Moreover, optimizing models of both one- and two-ring geometries using differential evolution, we find that a single ring having a Hong-like scattering phase function matches the data equally well within the CHARIS field of view (ρ ≲ 1″). The disk's asymmetry, well evidenced at larger separations, is also recovered; the west side of the disk appears, on average, around 0.4 mag brighter across the CHARIS bandpass between 0"25 and 1″. Comparing Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) 50CCD optical photometry (2000-10500 Å) with CHARIS near-infrared photometry, we find a red (STIS/50CCD-CHARIS broadband) color for both sides of the disk throughout the 0"4-1″ region of overlap, in contrast to the blue color reported at similar wavelengths for regions exterior to ∼2″. Further, this color may suggest a smaller minimum grain size than previously estimated at larger separations.

The sample was selected for large infrared excess and age ∼10 Myr, to characterize the prevalence of molecular gas emission in young debris disks. We identify three CO-rich debris disks, plus two additional tentative (3σ) CO detections. Twenty disks were detected in the continuum at the {\textgreater}3σ level. For the 12 disks in the sample that are spatially resolved by our observations, we perform an independent analysis of the interferometric continuum visibilities to constrain the basic dust disk geometry, as well as a simultaneous analysis of the visibilities and broadband spectral energy distribution to constrain the characteristic grain size and disk mass. The gas-rich debris disks exhibit preferentially larger outer radii in their dust disks, and a higher prevalence of characteristic grain sizes smaller than the blowout size. The gas-rich disks do not exhibit preferentially larger dust masses, contrary to expectations for a scenario in which a higher cometary destruction rate would be expected to result in a larger mass of both CO and dust. The three debris disks in our sample with strong CO detections are all around A stars: the conditions in disks around intermediate-mass stars appear to be the most conducive to the survival or formation of CO.},

	abstract = {We present Subaru/HiCIAO H-band high-contrast images of the debris disk around HIP 79977, whose presence was recently inferred from an infrared excess. Our images resolve the disk for the first time, allowing characterization of its shape, size, and dust grain properties. We use angular differential imaging (ADI) to reveal the disk geometry in unpolarized light out to a radius of {\textasciitilde}2'', as well as polarized differential imaging to measure the degree of scattering polarization out to {\textasciitilde}1.''5. In order to strike a favorable balance between suppression of the stellar halo and conservation of disk flux, we explore the application of principal component analysis to both ADI and reference star subtraction. This allows accurate forward modeling of the effects of data reduction on simulated disk images, and thus direct comparison with the imaged disk. The resulting best-fit values and well-fitting intervals for the model parameters are a surface brightness power-law slope of S out = -3.2[ - 3.6, -2.9], an inclination of i = 84°[81°, 86°], a high Henyey-Greenstein forward-scattering parameter of g = 0.45[0.35, 0.60], and a non-significant disk-star offset of u = 3.0[ - 1.5, 7.5] AU = 24[ - 13, 61] mas along the line of nodes. Furthermore, the tangential linear polarization along the disk rises from {\textasciitilde}10\% at 0.''5 to {\textasciitilde}45\% at 1.''5. These measurements paint a consistent picture of a disk of dust grains produced by collisional cascades and blown out to larger radii by stellar radiation pressure.

	abstract = {Context. Debris disks are observed around 10 to 20\% of FGK main-sequence stars as infrared excess emission. They are important signposts for the presence of colliding planetesimals and therefore provide important information about the evolution of planetary systems. Direct imaging of such disks reveals their geometric structure and constrains their dust-particle properties. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We present observations of the known edge-on debris disk around HIP 79977 (HD 146897) taken with the ZIMPOL differential polarimeter of the SPHERE instrument. We measure the observed polarization signal and investigate the diagnostic potential of such data with model simulations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: SPHERE-ZIMPOL polarimetric data of the 15 Myr-old F star HIP 79977 (Upper Sco, 123 pc) were taken in the Very Broad Band (VBB) filter (λ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 735 nm, Δλ = 290 nm) with a spatial resolution of about 25 mas. Imaging polarimetry efficiently suppresses the residual speckle noise from the AO system and provides a differential signal with relatively small systematic measuring uncertainties. We measure the polarization flux along and perpendicular to the disk spine of the highly inclined disk for projected separations between 0.2'' (25 AU) and 1.6'' (200 AU). We perform model calculations for the polarized flux of an optically thin debris disk which are used to determine or constrain the disk parameters of HIP 79977. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We measure a polarized flux contrast ratio for the disk of (F{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}pol{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}){\textless}SUB{\textgreater}disk{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/F{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = (5.5 ± 0.9) × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} in the VBB filter. The surface brightness of the polarized flux reaches a maximum of SB{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}max{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 16.2 mag arcsec{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} at a separation of 0.2''-0.5'' along the disk spine with a maximum surface brightness contrast of 7.64 mag arcsec{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. The polarized flux has a minimum near the star \&lt;0.2'' because no or only little polarization is produced by forward or backward scattering in the disk section lying in front of or behind the star. The width of the disk perpendicular to the spine shows a systematic increase in FWHM from 0.1'' (12 AU) to 0.3''-0.5'', when going from a separation of 0.2'' to \&gt;1''. This can be explained by a radial blow-out of small grains. The data are modelled as a circular dust belt with a well defined disk inclination i = 85( ± 1.5)° and a radius between r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 60 and 90 AU. The radial density dependence is described by (r/r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}){\textless}SUP{\textgreater}α{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} with a steep (positive) power law index α = 5 inside r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and a more shallow (negative) index α = -2.5 outside r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The scattering asymmetry factor lies between g = 0.2 and 0.6 (forward scattering) adopting a scattering-angle dependence for the fractional polarization such as that for Rayleigh scattering. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Polarimetric imaging with SPHERE-ZIMPOL of the edge-on debris disk around HIP 79977 provides accurate profiles for the polarized flux. Our data are qualitatively very similar to the case of AU Mic and they confirm that edge-on debris disks have a polarization minimum at a position near the star and a maximum near the projected separation of the main debris belt. The comparison of the polarized flux contrast ratio (F{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}pol{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}){\textless}SUB{\textgreater}disk{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/F{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} with the fractional infrared excess provides strong constraints on the scattering albedo of the dust.},

	abstract = {We present H-band scattered light imaging of a bright debris disk around the A0 star HD 36546 obtained from the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) system with data recorded by the HiCIAO camera using the vector vortex coronagraph. SCExAO traces the disk from r ∼ 0.″3 to r ∼ 1″ (34-114 au). The disk is oriented in a near east-west direction (PA ∼ 75°), is inclined by I ∼ 70°-75°, and is strongly forward-scattering (g {\textgreater} 0.5). It is an extended disk rather than a sharp ring; a second, diffuse dust population extends from the disk’s eastern side. While HD 36546 intrinsic properties are consistent with a wide age range (t ∼ 1-250 Myr), its kinematics and analysis of coeval stars suggest a young age (3-10 Myr) and a possible connection to Taurus-Auriga’s star formation history. SCExAO’s planet-to-star contrast ratios are comparable to the first-light Gemini Planet Imager contrasts; for an age of 10 Myr, we rule out planets with masses comparable to HR 8799 b beyond a projected separation of 23 au. A massive icy planetesimal disk or an unseen super-Jovian planet at r {\textgreater} 20 au may explain the disk’s visibility. The HD 36546 debris disk may be the youngest debris disk yet imaged, is the first newly identified object from the now-operational SCExAO extreme AO system, is ideally suited for spectroscopic follow-up with SCExAO/CHARIS in 2017, and may be a key probe of icy planet formation and planet-disk interactions.},

SCExAO/CHARIS resolves the disk down to smaller angular separations of (0.″11 r ∼ 14 au) and at a higher significance than previously achieved at the same wavelengths. The disk exhibits a marginally significant east-west brightness asymmetry in H band that requires confirmation. Geometrical modeling suggests a nearly edge-on disk viewed at a position angle of ∼114.°6 east of north. The disk is best-fit by scattered-light models assuming strongly forward-scattering grains (g ∼ 0.5-0.65) confined to a torus with a peak density at r 0 ∼ 53-75 au. We find that a shallow outer density power law of α out = -1 to -3 and flare index of β = 1 are preferred. Other disk parameters (e.g., inner density power law and vertical scale height) are more poorly constrained. The disk has a slightly blue intrinsic color and its profile is broadly consistent with predictions from birth ring models applied to other debris disks. While HIP 79977's disk appears to be more strongly forward-scattering than most resolved disks surrounding 5-30 Myr old stars, this difference may be due to observational biases favoring forward-scattering models for inclined disks versus lower inclination, ostensibly neutral-scattering disks like HR 4796A’s. Deeper, higher signal-to-noise SCExAO/CHARIS data can better constrain the disk’s dust composition.},

Observations were carried out in the near-IR (2.2 μm) at the Palomar 200 inch telescope using the adaptive optics system PALAO. The main large-scale asymmetric features of the disk are detected on our ground-based data. In addition, we measured that the surface brightness of the disk is slightly different than that derived by HST observations (at 1.1 and 1.6 μm). We interpret this possible color effect in terms of dust properties and derive a minimal grain size of 0.6+/-0.2 μm for compact grains and a power-law index for the grain size distribution smaller than -3. Basic dynamical considerations are consistent with the presence of a remnant amount of gas in the disk.},

The VLA observations achieve a resolution of 0.25 arcsec (∼28 au) and a sensitivity of 4.7 μJy beam- 1. We find (1) a 52 ± 5 μJy point source at the location of HD 141569A that shows potential variability, (2) the detected flux is contained within the SED-inferred central clearing of the disc meaning the spectral index of the dust disc is steeper than previously inferred, and (3) the M dwarf companions are also detected and variable. Previous lower resolution VLA observations (semester 14A) found a higher flux density, interpreted as solely dust emission. When combined with ALMA observations, the VLA 14A observations suggested the spectral index, and grain size distribution of HD 141569's disc was shallow and an outlier among debris systems. Using archival ALMA observations of HD 141569 at 0.87 and 2.9 mm, we find a dust spectral index of αmm = 1.81 ± 0.20. The VLA 16A flux corresponds to a brightness temperature of ∼5 × 106 K, suggesting strong non-disc emission is affecting the inferred grain properties. The VLA 16A flux density of the M2V companion HD 141569B is 149 ± 9 μJy, corresponding to a brightness temperature of ∼2 × 108 K and suggesting significant stellar variability when compared to the VLA14A observations, which are smaller by a factor of ∼6.},

Our 870 μm ALMA continuum observations resolve a dust disk out to approximately 56 au from the star (assuming a distance of 116 pc) with 0.″38 resolution and 0.07 mJy beam-1 sensitivity. We measure a continuum flux density for this inner material of 3.8 ± 0.4 mJy (including calibration uncertainties). The 12CO(3-2) gas is resolved kinematically and spatially from about 30 to 210 au. The integrated 12CO(3-2) line flux density is 15.7 ± 1.6 Jy km s-1. We estimate the mass of the millimeter debris and 12CO(3-2) gas to be ≳0.04 M ⊕ and ∼2 × 10-3 M ⊕, respectively. If the millimeter grains are part of a collisional cascade, then we infer that the inner disk ({\textless}50 au) has ∼160 M ⊕ contained within objects less than 50 km in radius, depending on the planetesimal size distribution and density assumptions. Markov Chain Monte Carlo modeling of the system reveals a disk morphology with an inclination of 53.°4 centered around an M = 2.39 M ⊙ host star (Msin(I) = 1.92 M ⊙).

Model fits to an assumed flat radially symmetric dust disk yield an inclination i=53deg+/-5deg and a position angle of -6deg+/-4deg for the tilt axis and indicate the presence of a depression in optical depth by a factor of about 4 within a radial distance of 30 AU (0.3") from the star. Such a depression is suggestive of a density depletion and is consistent with published spectral energy distributions that indicate the absence of a near-infrared excess even though a mid-infrared excess is present. Our mid-infrared results, in conjunction with previously published near-infrared scattering images, suggest that the two wavelength regimes are viewing, respectively, the inner and outer parts of a common disk structure, which is dominated by small (probably submicron) grains throughout.},

	abstract = {Some circumstellar disks, called transitional or hybrid disks, present characteristics of both protoplanetary disks (significant amount of gas) and debris disks (evolved structures around young main-sequence stars, composed of second generation dust, from collisions between planetesimals). Therefore, they are ideal astrophysical laboratories to witness the last stages of planet formation. The circumstellar disk around HD 141569A was intensively observed and resolved in the past from space, but also from the ground. However, the recent implementation of high contrast imaging systems has opened up new opportunities to re-analyze this object. We analyzed Gemini archival data from the Near-infrared Coronagraphic Imager obtained in 2011 in the H band, using several angular differential imaging techniques (classical ADI, LOCI, KLIP). These images reveal the complex structures of this disk with an unprecedented resolution. We also include archival Hubble Space Telescope images as an independent data set to confirm these findings. Using an analysis of the inner edge of the disk, we show that the inner disk is almost axisymmetrical. The measurement of an offset toward the east observed by previous authors is likely due to the fact that the eastern part of this disk is wider and more complex in substructure. Our precise reanalysis of the eastern side shows several structures, including a splitting of the disk and a small finger detached from the inner edge to the southeast. Finally, we find that the arc at 250 AU is unlikely to be a spiral, at least not at the inclination derived from the first ring, but instead could be interpreted as a third belt at a different inclination. If the very symmetrical inner disk edge is carved by a companion, the data presented here put additional constraints on its position. The observed very complex structures will be confirmed by the new generation of coronagraphic instrument (GPI, SPHERE). However, a full understanding of this system will require gas observations at millimetric wavelengths.},

Keck Observatory Keck II adaptive optics system. We used reference point-spread function subtraction, which reveals the innermost disk component from the inner working distance of ≃23 au and up to ≃70 au. The spatial scale of our detection roughly corresponds to the optical and near-infrared scattered light, thermal Q, N, and 8.6 μm PAH emission reported earlier. We also see an outward progression in dust location from the L‧ band to the H band (Very Large Telescope/SPHERE image) to the visible (Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/STIS image), which is likely indicative of dust blowout. The warm disk component is nested deep inside the two outer belts imaged by HST-NICMOS in 1999 (at 406 and 245 au, respectively). We fit our new L‧-band image and spectral energy distribution of HD 141569 A with the radiative transfer code MCFOST. Our best-fit models favor pure olivine grains and are consistent with the composition of the outer belts. While our image shows a putative very faint point-like clump or source embedded in the inner disk, we did not detect any true companion within the gap between the inner disk and the first outer ring, at a sensitivity of a few Jupiter masses.},

	abstract = {Using Keck/NIRC2 \{L\}{\textbackslash}prime (3.78 μm) data, we report the direct imaging discovery of a scattered-light-resolved, solar-system-scale residual protoplanetary disk around the young A-type star HD 141569A, interior to and concentric with the two ring-like structures at wider separations. The disk is resolved down to ∼0.″25 and appears as an arc-like rim with attached hook-like features. It is located at an angular separation intermediate between that of warm CO gas identified from spatially resolved mid-infrared spectroscopy and diffuse dust emission recently discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope. The inner disk has a radius of ∼39 au, a position angle consistent with north up, and an inclination of I ∼ 56o and has a center offset from the star. Forward modeling of the disk favors a thick torus-like emission sharply truncated at separations beyond the torus’s photocenter and heavily depleted at smaller separations. In particular, the best-fit density power law for the dust suggests that the inner disk dust and gas (as probed by CO) are radially segregated, a feature consistent with the dust trapping mechanism inferred from observations of “canonical” transitional disks. However, the inner disk component may instead be explained by radiation pressure-induced migration in optically thin conditions, in contrast to the two stellar companion/planet-influenced ring-like structures at wider separations. HD 141569A’s circumstellar environment—with three nested, gapped, concentric dust populations—is an excellent laboratory for understanding the relationship between planet formation and the evolution of both dust grains and disk architecture.},

	abstract = {Context. Transition disks correspond to a short stage between the young protoplanetary phase and older debris phase. Along this evolutionary sequence, the gas component disappears leaving room for a dust-dominated environment where already-formed planets signpost their gravitational perturbations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We endeavor to study the very inner region of the well-known and complex debris, but still gas-rich disk, around HD 141569A using the exquisite high-contrast capability of SPHERE at the VLT. Recent near-infrared (IR) images suggest a relatively depleted cavity within {\textasciitilde}200 au, while former mid-IR data indicate the presence of dust at separations shorter than {\textasciitilde}100 au. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We obtained multi-wavelength images in the near-IR in J, H2, H3 and Ks-bands with the IRDIS camera and a 0.95-1.35 μm spectral data cube with the IFS. Data were acquired in pupil-tracking mode, thus allowing for angular differential imaging. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We discovered several new structures inside 1'', of which the most prominent is a bright ring with sharp edges (semi-major axis: 0.4'') featuring a strong north-south brightness asymmetry. Other faint structures are also detected from 0.4'' to 1'' in the form of concentric ringlets and at least one spiral arm. Finally, the VISIR data at 8.6 μm suggests the presence of an additional dust population closer in. Besides, we do not detect companions more massive than 1-3 mass of Jupiter. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The performance of SPHERE allows us to resolve the extended dust component, which was previously detected at thermal and visible wavelengths, into very complex patterns with strong asymmetries; the nature of these asymmetries remains to be understood. Scenarios involving shepherding by planets or dust-gas interactions will have to be tested against these observations. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on data collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, ESO programs 095.C-0381 and 095.C-0298.},

The discovered inner disk component, obtained in broadband optical light with Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph coronagraphy, was imaged with an inner working angle of 0.″25, and can be traced from 0.″4 (∼46 AU) to 1.″0 (∼116 AU) after deprojection using I = 55°. The inner disk component is seen to forward scatter in a manner similar to the previously known rings, has a pericenter offset of ∼6 AU, and break points where the slope of the surface brightness changes. It also has a spiral arm trailing in the same sense as other spiral arms and arcs seen at larger stellocentric distances. The inner disk spatially overlaps with the previously reported warm gas disk seen in thermal emission. We detect no point sources within 2″ (∼232 AU), in particular in the gap between the inner disk component and the inner ring. Our upper limit of 9 ± 3 MJ is augmented by a new dynamical limit on single planetary mass bodies in the gap between the inner disk component and the inner ring of 1 MJ, which is broadly consistent with previous estimates.

The B, V, and I images show that the disk's previously described multiple-ring structure is actually a continuous distribution of dust with a tightly wound spiral structure. Extending from the disk are two, more open spiral arms, one of which appears to reach the nearby binary star HD 141569BC. Diffuse dust is seen up to 1200 AU from HD 141569A. Although planets may exist in the inner region of the disk, tidal interaction with HD 141569BC seems more likely to be the cause of these phenomena. The disk appears redder than the star (B-V=0.21 and V-I=0.25), and its color is spatially uniform. A scattering asymmetry factor of g=0.25-0.35 is derived.

The data, with a spatial resolution and signal to noise higher than those previously obtained with HST/NICMOS2 allow a more detailed insight in the system. They reveal a very structured system, in which two ring-like structures at distances ={\textasciitilde} 200 and 325 AU from the star are the most prominent features. The region between 125 and 175 AU is clearly devoid of material. An arc-like structure is also detected at about 250 AU, as well as a diffuse extended emission, both on the North side of the disk. The system appears to be highly asymmetrical, both with respect to its major and minor axes. Surprisingly, the brightness asymmetry with respect to both axes in the inner and outer parts of the disk is reversed. Possible explanations to the asymmetries include anisotropic scattering and/or non axisymmetrical distribution of the dust within the system. It is shown that anisotropic scattering cannot alone be responsible for all observed asymmetries. It is concluded that HD 141569 disk is non axi-symmetrical. Eventhough no detailed modeling is given in this observational paper, it is probable that the sculpting and brightness properties of the disk are due to the gravitational perturbation of a massive body.

To these data we added near-infrared and mid-infrared photometry, and collected Hα emission line properties such as equivalent widths and line profiles, and their binarity status. In addition, we developed a photometric variability indicator from Gaia's DR2 information. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We provide masses, ages, luminosities, distances, photometric variabilities and IR excesses homogeneously derived for the most complete sample of Herbig Ae/Be stars to date. We find that high-mass stars have a much smaller IR excess and have much lower optical variabilities compared to lower-mass stars, with the break at around 7 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Hα emission is generally correlated with IR excess, with the correlation being stronger for IR emission at wavelengths tracing the hot dust closest to the star. The variability indicator as developed by us shows that ∼25\% of all Herbig Ae/Be stars are strongly variable. We observe that the strongly variable objects display doubly peaked Hα line profiles, indicating an edge-on disk. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The fraction of strongly variable Herbig Ae stars is close to that found for A-type UX Ori stars. It had been suggested that this variability is in most cases due to asymmetric dusty disk structures seen edge-on. The observation here is in strong support of this hypothesis. Finally, the difference in dust properties occurs at 7 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, while various properties traced at UV/optical wavelengths differ at a lower mass, 3 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}.

Most of these objects show IR excesses in their spectral energy distributions, which are indicative of the presence of disks. The work is relevant in the fields of stellar physics, physics of disks and formation of planetary systems. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Aims: The aim of the work is the determination of the effective temperature, gravity, metallicity, mass, luminosity and age of these stars. An accurate modelling of their disks requires the knowledge of most of these parameters, since they will determine the energy input received by the disk and hence, its geometry and global properties. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: Spectral energy distributions and mid-resolution spectra were used to estimate T\_eff, the effective temperature.

Once T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, g{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and [M/H] are known for each star, evolutionary tracks and isochrones provide estimations of the mass, luminosity, age and distances (or upper limits in some cases).

Gemini Planet Imager H-band (1.65 μm) polarimetric differential imaging reveals the highest signal-to-noise ratio detection of this ring yet attained and traces structure inward to 0.″25 (28 au at a distance of 111 pc). The radial polarized intensity image shows the east side of the disk, peaking in intensity at 0.″40 (44 au) and extending out to 0.″9 (100 au). There is a spiral arm-like enhancement to the south, reminiscent of the known spiral structures on the outer rings of the disk. The location of the spiral arm is coincident with 12CO J = 3-2 emission detected by ALMA and hints at a dynamically active inner circumstellar region. Our observations also show a portion of the middle dusty ring at ∼220 au known from previous observations of this system. We fit the polarized H-band emission with a continuum radiative transfer Mie model. Our best-fit model favors an optically thin disk with a minimum dust grain size close to the blowout size for this system, evidence of ongoing dust production in the inner reaches of the disk. The thermal emission from this model accounts for virtually all of the far-infrared and millimeter flux from the entire HD 141569A disk, in agreement with the lack of ALMA continuum and CO emission beyond ∼100 au. A remaining 8-30 μm thermal excess a factor of ∼2 above our model argues for an as-yet-unresolved warm innermost 5-15 au component of the disk.},

	abstract = {Context. The combination of high-contrast imaging with spectroscopy and polarimetry offers a pathway to studying the grain distribution and properties of debris disks in exquisite detail. Here, we focus on the case of a gas-rich debris disk around HD 141569A, which features a multiple-ring morphology first identified with SPHERE in the near-infrared. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We obtained polarimetric differential imaging with SPHERE in the H-band to compare the scattering properties of the innermost ring at 44 au with former observations in total intensity with the same instrument. In polarimetric imaging, we observed that the intensity of the ring peaks in the south-east, mostly in the forward direction, whereas in total intensity imaging, the ring is detected only at the south. This noticeable characteristic suggests a non-uniform dust density in the ring. With these two sets of images, we aim to study the distribution of the dust to solve for the actual dust distribution. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We implemented a density function varying azimuthally along the ring and generated synthetic images both in polarimetry and in total intensity, which are then compared to the actual data. The search for the best-fit model was performed both with a grid-based and an MCMC approach. Using the outcome of this modelization, we further measured the polarized scattering phase function for the observed scattering angle between 33° and 147° as well as the spectral reflectance of the southern part of the ring between 0.98 and 2.1 μm. We tentatively derived the grain properties by comparing these quantities with MCFOST models and assuming Mie scattering. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find that the dust density peaks in the south-west at an azimuthal angle of 220°{\textasciitilde}238° with a rather broad width of 61°{\textasciitilde}127°. The difference in the intensity distributions observed in polarimetry and total intensity is the result of this particular morphology. Although there are still uncertainties that remain in the determination of the anisotropic scattering factor, the implementation of an azimuthal density variation to fit the data proved to be robust. Upon elaborating on the origin of this dust density distribution, we conclude that it could be the result of a massive collision when we account for the effect of the high gas mass that is present in the system on the dynamics of grains. In terms of grain composition, our preliminary interpretation indicates a mixture of porous sub-micron sized astro-silicate and carbonaceous grains. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The SPHERE observations have allowed, for the first time, for meaningful constraints to be placed on the dust distribution beyond the standard picture of a uniform ring-like debris disk. However, future studies with a multiwavelength approach and additional detailed modeling would be required to better characterize the grain properties in the HD 141569 system.},

	abstract = {Context. To characterize the mechanisms of planet formation it is crucial to investigate the properties and evolution of protoplanetary disks around young stars, where the initial conditions for the growth of planets are set. The high spatial resolution of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations now allows the study of radial variations of dust properties in nearby resolved disks and the investigation of the early stages of grain growth in disk midplanes. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Our goal is to study grain growth in the well-studied disk of the young, intermediate-mass star HD 163296 where dust processing has already been observed and to look for evidence of growth by ice condensation across the CO snowline, which has already been identified in this disk with ALMA. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Under the hypothesis of optically thin emission, we compare images at different wavelengths from ALMA and VLA to measure the opacity spectral index across the disk and thus the maximum grain size. We also use a Bayesian tool based on a two-layer disk model to fit the observations and constrain the dust surface density. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The measurements of the opacity spectral index indicate the presence of large grains and pebbles (≥1 cm) in the inner regions of the disk (inside {\textasciitilde}50 AU) and smaller grains, consistent with ISM sizes, in the outer disk (beyond 150 AU). Re-analyzing ALMA Band 7 science verification data, we find (radially) unresolved excess continuum emission centered near the location of the CO snowline at {\textasciitilde}90 AU. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a grain size distribution consistent with an enhanced production of large grains at the CO snowline and consequent transport to the inner regions. Our results combined with the excess in infrared scattered light suggests there is a structure at 90 AU involving the whole vertical extent of the disk. This could be evidence of small scale processing of dust at the CO snowline.},

	abstract = {Context. The morphological evolution of dusty disks around young (a few Myr old) stars is pivotal for a better understanding of planet formation. Since both dust grains and the global disk geometry evolve on short timescales, high-resolution imaging of a sample of objects may provide important indications about this evolution. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We enlarge the sample of protoplanetary disks imaged in polarized light with high-resolution imaging (≲0.2″) by observing the Herbig Ae/Be stars HD 163296, HD 141569A, and HD 150193A. We combine our data with previous datasets to understand the larger context of their morphology. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Polarimetric differential imaging is an attractive technique with which to image at near-IR wavelengths a significant fraction of the light scattered by the circumstellar material. The unpolarized stellar light is canceled out by combining two simultaneous orthogonal polarization states. This allowed us to achieve an inner working angle and an angular resolution as low as {\textasciitilde}0.1″. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We report a weak detection of the disk around HD 163296 in the H and K{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}S{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} bands. The disk is resolved as a broken ring structure with a significant surface brightness drop inward of 0.6″. No sign of extended polarized emission is detected from the disk around HD 141569A and HD 150193A. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We propose that the absence of scattered light in the inner 0.6″ around HD 163296 and the non-detection of the disk around HD 150193A may be due to similar geometric factors. Since these disks are known to be flat or only moderately flared, self-shadowing by the disk inner wall is the favored explanation. We show that the polarized brightness of a number of disks is indeed related to their flaring angle. Other scenarios (such as dust grain growth or interaction with icy molecules) are also discussed. On the other hand, the non-detection of HD 141569A is consistent with previous datasets that revealed a huge cavity in the dusty disk. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, Chile, under program number 089.C-0611(A).},

Multiwavelength observations are indispensable in studying disk geometry and dust evolution processes in protoplanetary disks. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to construct a three-dimensional model of HD 163296 that is capable of reproducing simultaneously new observations of the disk surface in scattered light with the SPHERE instrument and thermal emission continuum observations of the disk midplane with ALMA. We want to determine why the spectral energy distribution of HD 163296 is intermediary between the otherwise well-separated group I and group II Herbig stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The disk was modeled using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCMax3D. The radial dust surface density profile was modeled after the ALMA observations, while the polarized scattered light observations were used to constrain the inclination of the inner disk component and turbulence and grain growth in the outer disk. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: While three rings are observed in the disk midplane in millimeter thermal emission at 80, 124, and 200 AU, only the innermost of these is observed in polarized scattered light, indicating a lack of small dust grains on the surface of the outer disk. We provide two models that are capable of explaining this difference. The first model uses increased settling in the outer disk as a mechanism to bring the small dust grains on the surface of the disk closer to the midplane and into the shadow cast by the first ring. The second model uses depletion of the smallest dust grains in the outer disk as a mechanism for decreasing the optical depth at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. In the region outside the fragmentation-dominated regime, such depletion is expected from state-of-the-art dust evolution models. We studied the effect of creating an artificial inner cavity in our models, and conclude that HD 163296 might be a precursor to typical group I sources.},

	abstract = {We present the first multicolor view of the scattered light disk of the Herbig Ae star HD 163296, based on coronagraphic observations from the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST ACS). Radial profile fits of the surface brightness along the disk's semimajor axis indicate that the disk is not continuously flared, and extends to {\textasciitilde}540 AU. The disk's color (V - I) = 1.1 at a radial distance of 3.5'' is redder than the observed stellar color (V - I) = 0.15. This red disk color might be indicative of either an evolution in the grain size distribution (i.e., grain growth) and/or composition, both of which would be consistent with the observed nonflared geometry of the outer disk. We also identify a single ansa morphological structure in our F435W ACS data, which is absent from earlier epoch F606W and F814W ACS data, but corresponds to one of the two ansae observed in archival HST Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) coronagraphic data. Following transformation to similar bandpasses, we find that the scattered light disk of HD 163296 is 1 mag arcsec-2 fainter at 3.5'' in the STIS data than in the ACS data. Moreover, variations are seen in (1) the visibility of the ansa(e) structures, (2) the relative surface brightness of the ansa(e) structures, and (3) the (known) intrinsic polarization of the system. These results indicate that the scattered light from the HD 163296 disk is variable. We speculate that the inner disk wall, which Sitko et al. suggests has a variable scale height as diagnosed by near-IR SED variability, induces variable self-shadowing of the outer disk. We further speculate that the observed surface brightness variability of the ansa(e) structures may indicate that the inner disk wall is azimuthally asymmetric.},

The polarimetric imagery resolve a broken ring structure surrounding HD 163296 that peaks at a distance along the major axis of 0.″65 (66 au) and extends out to 0.″98 (100 au) along the major axis. Our 2011 H-band data exhibit clear axisymmetry, with the NW and SE side of the disk exhibiting similar intensities.

Collectively, these results indicate the presence of time-variable, non-azimuthally symmetric illumination of the outer disk. While our SCExAO/CHARIS data are sensitive enough to recover the planet candidate identified from NIRC2 in the thermal infrared (IR), we fail to detect an object with JHK brightness nominally consistent with this object. This suggests that the candidate is either fainter in JHK bands than model predictions, possibly due to extinction from the disk or atmospheric dust/clouds, or that it is an artifact of the data set/data processing, such as a residual speckle or partially subtracted disk feature.

	abstract = {The origin of the magnetic fields observed in some intermediate-mass and high-mass main-sequence stars is still a matter of vigorous debate. The favoured hypothesis is a fossil field origin, in which the observed fields are the condensed remnants of magnetic fields present in the original molecular cloud from which the stars formed. According to this theory a few per cent of the pre-main-sequence (PMS) Herbig Ae/Be star should be magnetic with a magnetic topology similar to that of main-sequence intermediate-mass stars. After our recent discovery of four magnetic Herbig stars, we have decided to study in detail one of them, HD200775, to determine if its magnetic topology is similar to that of the main-sequence magnetic stars. With this aim, we monitored this star in Stokes I and V over more than 2yr, using the new spectropolarimeters ESPaDOnS at Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), and Narval at Bernard Lyot Telescope (TBL). By analysing the intensity spectrum we find that HD200775 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, whose secondary seems similar, in temperature, to the primary. We have carefully compared the observed spectrum to a synthetic one, and we found no evidence of abundance anomalies in its spectrum. We infer the luminosity ratio of the components from the Stokes I profiles. Then, using the temperature and luminosity of HD200775 found in the literature, we estimate the age, the mass and the radius of both components from their HR diagram positions. From our measurements of the radial velocities of both stars we determine the ephemeris and the orbital parameters of the system. A Stokes V Zeeman signature is clearly visible in most of the least-squares deconvolution profiles and varies on a time-scale on the order of 1d. We have fitted the 30 profiles simultaneously, using a χ2 minimization method, with a centred and a decentred-dipole model. The best-fitting model is obtained with a reduced χ2 = 1.0 and provides a rotation period of 4.3281 +/- 0.0010d, an inclination angle of 60° +/- 11° and a magnetic obliquity angle β = 125° +/- 8°. The polar strength of the magnetic dipole field is 1000 +/- 150G, which is decentred by 0.05 +/- 0.04R* from the centre of the star. The derived magnetic field model is qualitatively identical to those commonly observed in the Ap/Bp stars. Our determination of the inclination of the rotation axis leads to a radius of the primary which is smaller than that derived from the HR diagram position. This can be explained by a larger intrinsic luminosity of the secondary relative to the primary, due to a larger circumstellar extinction of the secondary relative to the primary.

Most of the vortex coronagraph mask development for space applications has focused on generating a polychromatic, vectorial, optical vortex using multiple layers of liquid crystal polymers. While this approach has been the most successful thus far, current fabrication processes achieve retardance errors of 0.1-1.0\&deg;, which causes a nonnegligible fraction of the starlight to leak through the coronagraph. Circular polarizers are typically used to reject the stellar leakage reducing the throughput by a factor of two. Vector vortex masks also complicate wavefront control because they imprint conjugated phase ramps on the orthogonal circular polarization components, which may need to be split in order to properly sense and suppress the starlight. Scalar vortex masks can potentially circumvent these limitations by applying the same phase shift to all incident light regardless of the polarization state and thus have the potential to significantly improve the performance of vortex coronagraphs. We present scalar vortex coronagraph designs that make use of focal plane masks with multiple layers of dielectrics that (a) produce phase patterns that are relatively friendly to standard manufacturing processes and (b) achieve sufficient broadband starlight suppression, in theory, for imaging Earth-like planets with future space telescopes.},

	abstract = {Context. Differentiating between a true exoplanet signal and residual speckle noise is a key challenge in high-contrast imaging (HCI). Speckles result from a combination of fast, slow, and static wavefront aberrations introduced by atmospheric turbulence and instrument optics. While wavefront control techniques developed over the last decade have shown promise in minimizing fast atmospheric residuals, slow and static aberrations such as non-common path aberrations (NCPAs) remain a key limiting factor for exoplanet detection. NCPAs are not seen by the wavefront sensor (WFS) of the adaptive optics (AO) loop, hence the difficulty in correcting them. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We propose to improve the identification and rejection of slow and static speckles in AO-corrected images. The algorithm known as the Direct Reinforcement Wavefront Heuristic Optimisation (DrWHO) performs a frequent compensation operation on static and quasi-static aberrations (including NCPAs) to boost image contrast. It is applicable to general-purpose AO systems as well as HCI systems. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: By changing the WFS reference at every iteration of the algorithm (a few tens of seconds), DrWHO changes the AO system point of convergence to lead it towards a compensation mechanism for the static and slow aberrations. References are calculated using an iterative lucky-imaging approach, where each iteration updates the WFS reference, ultimately favoring high-quality focal plane images. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We validated this concept through both numerical simulations and on-sky testing on the SCExAO instrument at the 8.2-m Subaru telescope. Simulations show a rapid convergence towards the correction of 82\% of the NCPAs. On-sky tests were performed over a 10 min run in the visible (750 nm). We introduced a flux concentration (FC) metric to quantify the point spread function (PSF) quality and measure a 15.7\% improvement compared to the pre-DrWHO image. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The DrWHO algorithm is a robust focal-plane wavefront sensing calibration method that has been successfully demonstrated on-sky. It does not rely on a model and does not require wavefront sensor calibration or linearity. It is compatible with different wavefront control methods, and can be further optimized for speed and efficiency. The algorithm is ready to be incorporated in scientific observations, enabling better PSF quality and stability during observations.},

	abstract = {A key challenge of high contrast imaging (HCI) is to differentiate a speckle from an exoplanet signal. The sources of speckles are a combination of atmospheric residuals and aberrations in the non-common path. Those non-common path aberrations (NCPA) are particularly challenging to compensate for as they are not directly measured, and because they include static, quasi-static and dynamic components. The proposed method directly addresses the challenge of compensating the NCPA. The algorithm DrWHO - Direct Reinforcement Wavefront Heuristic Optimisation - is a quasi-real-time compensation of static and dynamic NCPA for boosting image contrast. It is an image-based lucky imaging approach, aimed at finding and continuously updating the ideal reference of the wavefront sensor (WFS) that includes the NCPA, and updating this new reference to the WFS. Doing so changes the point of convergence of the AO loop. We show here the first results of a post-coronagraphic application of DrWHO. DrWHO does not rely on any model nor requires accurate wavefront sensor calibration, and is applicable to non-linear wavefront sensing situations. We present on-sky performances using a pyramid WFS sensor with the Subaru coronagraph extreme AO (SCExAO) instrument.},

The performance of AO188 in the natural guide star mode has been well verified from on-sky data obtained with the infrared camera and spectrograph (IRCS). Under normal seeing condition, AO188 achieves K-band Strehl ratio between 60\% and 70\% using R = 9.0 magnitude natural guide stars and it works well with faint guide stars down to R = 16.5 magnitude. We measured the FWHM and Strehl ratio of stellar images in globular clusters and found that the isoplanatic angle is approximately 30 arcsec.

A general analysis is presented, illustrated with the classical Lyot coronagraph and the newer four quadrant phase mask scheme. Two kinds of remnant speckles, of distinct symmetry, occur that are closely analogous to those arising in direct imaging at high correction. Properties and typical intensity estimates are presented, which are useful for estimating speckle noise and false companion detection levels and reduction strategies. For realistic parameters describing some current ground-based observations, the novel antisymmetric ``pinned'' speckles, usually neglected even in direct imaging, are nonnegligible in narrowband short exposures. For parameters appropriate to a space-borne coronagraph on the Hubble Space Telescope, these anomalous speckles are in fact dominant close to the star and thus a potentially significant source of false companion detections.},

Observing strategies and data rates vary from instrument to instrument and wavelength, and can result in tens of thousands of images to be combined. We here present a new approach, tailored for VLT/NaCo observations performed with the Annular Groove Phase Mask (AGPM) coronagraph at \$L'\$ filter. Our pipeline aims at improving the post-processing of the observations on two fronts: identifying the location of the star behind the AGPM to better align the science frames and performing frame selection. Our method relies on finding the position of the AGPM in the sky frame observations, and correlate it with the circular aperture of the coronagraphic mask. This relationship allows us to retrieve the location of the AGPM in the science frames, in turn allowing us to estimate the position of the star. In the process we also gather additional information useful for our frame selection approach. We tested our pipeline on several targets, and find that we improve the S/N of companions around \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pictoris and R CrA by \$24{\textbackslash}pm3\$ {\textbackslash}\% and \$117{\textbackslash}pm11\$ {\textbackslash}\% respectively, compared to other state-of-the-art reductions. The astrometry of the point sources is slightly different but remains compatible within \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ compared to published values. Finally, we find that even for NaCo observations with tens of thousands of frames, frame selection yields just marginal improvement for point sources but may improve the final images for objects with extended emission such as disks. We proposed a novel approach to identify the location of the star behind a coronagraph even when it cannot easily be determined by other methods, leading to better S/N for nearby point sources, and led a thorough study on the importance of frame selection, concluding that the improvements are marginal in most case.},

This study explores circumstellar disks with calculations for the intensity and polarization of the reflected light. The photon scattering and absorption by the disk are calculated with a Monte Carlo method for a grid of simple, rotationally symmetric models approximated at each point by a plane-parallel dusty atmosphere. The results of our simple disk models reproduce well the measurements for the intensity \$I/I\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$, azimuthal polarization \$Q\_\{{\textbackslash}varphi\}/I\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$, and fractional polarization \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}varphi\}\$ reported for well-observed transition disks. They describe the dependencies of the scattered radiation on the disk geometry and the dust scattering parameters in detail. Particularly strong constraints on disk properties can be obtained from certain diagnostic quantities. Therefore, they can be used as a diagnostic tool for the analysis of quantitative measurements, specifically in constraining or even determining the scattering properties of the dust particles in disks. Collecting and comparing such information for many systems is required to understand the nature of the scattering dust in planet-forming disks.},

	abstract = {We present the results of both laboratory and on sky astrometric characterization of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI). This characterization includes measurement of the pixel scale* of the integral field spectrograph (IFS), the position of the detector with respect to north, and optical distortion. Two of these three quantities (pixel scale and distortion) were measured in the laboratory using two transparent grids of spots, one with a square pattern and the other with a random pattern. The pixel scale in the laboratory was also estimate using small movements of the artificial star unit (ASU) in the GPI adaptive optics system. On sky, the pixel scale and the north angle are determined using a number of known binary or multiple systems and Solar System objects, a subsample of which had concurrent measurements at Keck Observatory. Our current estimate of the GPI pixel scale is 14.14 +/- 0.01 millarcseconds/pixel, and the north angle is -1.00 +/- 0.03°. Distortion is shown to be small, with an average positional residual of 0.26 pixels over the field of view, and is corrected using a 5th order polynomial. We also present results from Monte Carlo simulations of the GPI Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) assuming GPI achieves {\textasciitilde}1 milliarcsecond relative astrometric precision. We find that with this precision, we will be able to constrain the eccentricities of all detected planets, and possibly determine the underlying eccentricity distribution of widely separated Jovians.},

The polarized disk image was fit with a dust density model combined with a Henyey-Greenstein scattering phase function. The best-fit model indicates a disk inclined to the line of sight (φ =85{\textbackslash}buildrel\{{\textbackslash}circ\}{\textbackslash}over\{.\} \{27\}-0.19+0.26) with a position angle (PA) \{θ \}\{PA\}=30{\textbackslash}buildrel\{{\textbackslash}circ\}{\textbackslash}over\{.\} \{35\}-0.28+0.29 (slightly offset from the main outer disk, \{θ \}\{PA\}≈ 29{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ ), that extends from an inner disk radius of \{23.6\}-0.6+0.9 \{AU\} to well outside GPI’s field of view. In addition, we present an updated orbit for β Pic b based on new astrometric measurements taken in GPI’s spectroscopic mode spanning 14 months. The planet has a semimajor axis of a=\{9.2\}-0.4+1.5 \{AU\}, with an eccentricity e≤slant 0.26. The PA of the ascending node is \{\{Ω \}\}=31{\textbackslash}buildrel\{{\textbackslash}circ\}{\textbackslash}over\{.\} 75+/- 0{\textbackslash}buildrel\{{\textbackslash}circ\}{\textbackslash}over\{.\} 15, offset from both the outer main disk and the inner disk seen in the GPI image. The orbital fit constrains the stellar mass of β Pic to 1.60+/- 0.05 \{M\}⊙ . Dynamical sculpting by β Pic b cannot easily account for the following three aspects of the inferred disk properties: (1) the modeled inner radius of the disk is farther out than expected if caused by β Pic b; (2) the mutual inclination of the inner disk and β Pic b is ∼ 4{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ , when it is expected to be closer to zero; and (3) the aspect ratio of the disk (\{h\}0=\{0.137\}-0.006+0.005) is larger than expected from interactions with β Pic b or self-stirring by the disk’s parent bodies.},

	abstract = {We present a near-infrared image of the Herbig Ae star AB Aur obtained with the Coronagraphic Imager with Adaptive Optics mounted on the Subaru Telescope. The image shows a circumstellar emission extending out to a radius of r=580 AU, with a double spiral structure detected at r=200-450 AU. The surface brightness decreases as r-3.0+/-0.1, steeper than the radial profile of the optical emission possibly affected by the scattered light from the envelope surrounding AB Aur. This result, together with the size of the infrared emission similar to that of the 13CO (J=1-0) disk, suggests that the spiral structure is indeed associated with the circumstellar disk but is not part of the extended envelope. We identified four major spiral arms, which are trailing if the brighter southeastern part of the disk is the near side. The weak gravitational instability, maintained for millions of years by continuous mass supply from the envelope, might explain the presence of the spiral structure at the relatively late phase of the pre-main-sequence period.

	abstract = {The data torrent unleashed by current and upcoming astronomical surveys demands scalable analysis methods. Many machine learning approaches scale well, but separating the instrument measurement from the physical effects of interest, dealing with variable errors, and deriving parameter uncertainties is often an after-thought. Classic forward-folding analyses with Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Nested Sampling enable parameter estimation and model comparison, even for complex and slow-to-evaluate physical models. However, these approaches require independent runs for each data set, implying an unfeasible number of model evaluations in the Big Data regime. Here I present a new algorithm, collaborative nested sampling, for deriving parameter probability distributions for each observation. Importantly, the number of physical model evaluations scales sub-linearly with the number of data sets, and no assumptions about homogeneous errors, Gaussianity, the form of the model or heterogeneity/completeness of the observations need to be made. Collaborative nested sampling has immediate application in speeding up analyses of large surveys, integral-field-unit observations, and Monte Carlo simulations.},

	abstract = {Nested sampling is an iterative integration procedure that shrinks the prior volume towards higher likelihoods by removing a "live" point at a time. A replacement point is drawn uniformly from the prior above an ever-increasing likelihood threshold. Thus, the problem of drawing from a space above a certain likelihood value arises naturally in nested sampling, making algorithms that solve this problem a key ingredient to the nested sampling framework. If the drawn points are distributed uniformly, the removal of a point shrinks the volume in a well-understood way, and the integration of nested sampling is unbiased. In this work, I develop a statistical test to check whether this is the case. This "Shrinkage Test" is useful to verify nested sampling algorithms in a controlled environment. I apply the shrinkage test to a test-problem, and show that some existing algorithms fail to pass it due to over-optimisation. I then demonstrate that a simple algorithm can be constructed which is robust against this type of problem. This RADFRIENDS algorithm is, however, inefficient in comparison to MULTINEST.},

The accuracy and economy of the MULTINEST algorithm are demonstrated by application to two toy problems and to a cosmological inference problem focusing on the extension of the vanilla Λ cold dark matter model to include spatial curvature and a varying equation of state for dark energy. The MULTINEST software, which is fully parallelized using MPI and includes an interface to COSMOMC, is available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/multinest/.

We implement a new evidence algorithm known as nested sampling, which combines accuracy, generality of application, and computational feasibility, and we apply it to some cosmological data sets and models.

	abstract = {Markov chain sampling methods that adapt to characteristics of the distribution being sampled can be constructed using the principle that one can ample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal "slice" defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Such "slice sampling" methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by "overrelaxation," and for multivariate slice sampling by "reflection" from the edges of the slice.},

While this is not a comprehensive list, it includes processes for which our understanding has changed in recent years or for which key uncertainties remain. The second part of this review shows how global models are built out of planet formation processes. We present global models to explain different populations of known planetary systems, including close-in small/low-mass planets (i.e., super-Earths), giant exoplanets, and the Solar System's planets. We discuss the different sources of water on rocky exoplanets, and use cosmochemical measurements to constrain the origin of Earth's water. We point out the successes and failings of different models and how they may be falsified. Finally, we lay out a path for the future trajectory of planet formation studies.},

Considerable progress has been made over the past years in the physical description of the first stages of planetesimal formation, owing to extensive laboratory work. This review examines the experimental achievements and puts them into the context of the dust processes in protoplanetary disks. It has become clear that planetesimal formation starts with the growth of fractal dust aggregates, followed by compaction processes. As the dust-aggregate sizes increase, the mean collision velocity also increases, leading to the stalling of the growth and possibly to fragmentation, once the dust aggregates have reached decimeter sizes. A multitude of hypotheses for the further growth have been proposed, such as very sticky materials, secondary collision processes, enhanced growth at the snow line, or cumulative dust effects with gravitational instability. We will also critically review these ideas.},

	abstract = {Accumulation of dust and ice particles into planetesimals is an important step in the planet formation process. Planetesimals are the seeds of both terrestrial planets and the solid cores of gas and ice giants forming by core accretion. Leftover planetesimals in the form of asteroids, transneptunian objects, and comets provide a unique record of the physical conditions in the solar nebula. Debris from planetesimal collisions around other stars signposts that the planetesimal formation process, and hence planet formation, is ubiquitous in the Galaxy. The planetesimal formation stage extends from micrometer-sized dust and ice to bodies that can undergo runaway accretion. The latter ranges in size from 1 km to 1000 km, dependent on the planetesimal eccentricity excited by turbulent gas density fluctuations. Particles face many barriers during this growth, arising mainly from inefficient sticking, fragmentation, and radial drift. Two promising growth pathways are mass transfer, where small aggregates transfer up to 50\% of their mass in high-speed collisions with much larger targets, and fluffy growth, where aggregate cross sections and sticking probabilities are enhanced by a low internal density. A wide range of particle sizes, from 1 mm to 10 m, concentrate in the turbulent gas flow. Overdense filaments fragment gravitationally into bound particle clumps, with most mass entering planetesimals of contracted radii from 100 km to 500 km, depending on local disk properties. We propose a hybrid model for planetesimal formation where particle growth starts unaided by self-gravity but later proceeds inside gravitationally collapsing pebble clumps to form planetesimals with a wide range of sizes.},

	abstract = {Planets form and obtain their compositions in dust- and gas-rich disks around young stars, and the outcome of this process is intimately linked to the disk chemical properties. The distributions of molecules across disks regulate the elemental compositions of planets, including C/N/O/S ratios and metallicity (O/H and C/H), as well as access to water and prebiotically relevant organics. Emission from molecules also encodes information on disk ionization levels, temperature structures, kinematics, and gas surface densities, which are all key ingredients of disk evolution and planet formation models. The Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA Large Program was designed to expand our understanding of the chemistry of planet formation by exploring disk chemical structures down to 10 au scales. The MAPS program focuses on five disks-around IM Lup, GM Aur, AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480-in which dust substructures are detected and planet formation appears to be ongoing. We observed these disks in four spectral setups, which together cover {\textasciitilde}50 lines from over 20 different species. This paper introduces the Astrophysical Journal Supplement's MAPS Special Issue by presenting an overview of the program motivation, disk sample, observational details, and calibration strategy. We also highlight key results, including discoveries of links between dust, gas, and chemical substructures, large reservoirs of nitriles and other organics in the inner disk regions, and elevated C/O ratios across most disks. We discuss how this collection of results is reshaping our view of the chemistry of planet formation.},

	abstract = {Lucky imaging is now an established observing procedure that delivers near-diffraction-limited images in the visible on ground-based telescopes up to ∼2.5 m in diameter. Combined with low-order adaptive optics it can deliver a resolution several times better than that of the Hubble Space Telescope. Many images are taken at high speed as atmospheric turbulent effects appear static on these short time-scales. The sharpest images are selected, shifted and added to give a much higher resolution than is normally possible in ground-based long exposure time observations. The method is relatively inefficient as a significant fraction of the frames are discarded because of their relatively poor quality. This paper shows that a new lucky imaging processing method involving selection in Fourier space can substantially improve the selection percentages. The results show that high-resolution images with a large isoplanatic patch size may be obtained routinely both with conventional lucky imaging and with the new lucky Fourier method. Other methods of improving the sensitivity of the method to faint reference stars are also described.},

This paper proposes a novel lucky imaging algorithm where with space-domain and frequency-domain selection rates as a link, the two classic algorithms are combined successfully, making each algorithm a proper subset of the novel hybrid algorithm. Experimental results show that with the same experiment dataset and platform, the high-resolution image obtained by the proposed algorithm is superior to that obtained by the two classic algorithms. This paper also proposes a new lucky image selection and storage scheme, which can greatly save computer memory and enable lucky imaging algorithm to be implemented in a common desktop or laptop with small memory and to process astronomical images with more frames and larger size. In addition, through simulation analysis, this paper discusses the binary star detection limits of the novel lucky imaging algorithm and traditional ones under different atmospheric conditions.},

We also present H2/H3-band angular differential imaging (ADI) observations. Three distinct radial depressions in the polarized intensity distribution are seen, around ≈85, ≈21, and ≲6 au.21 The overall intensity distribution has a high degree of azimuthal symmetry; the disk is somewhat brighter than average toward the south and darker toward the north-west. The ADI observations yielded no signifiant detection of point sources in the disk. Our observations have a linear spatial resolution of 1-2 au, similar to that of recent ALMA dust continuum observations. The sub-micron-sized dust grains that dominate the light scattering in the disk surface are strongly coupled to the gas. We created a radiative transfer disk model with self-consistent temperature and vertical structure iteration and including grain size-dependent dust settling. This method may provide independent constraints on the gas distribution at higher spatial resolution than is feasible with ALMA gas line observations. We find that the gas surface density in the “gaps” is reduced by ≈50\% to ≈80\% relative to an unperturbed model. Should embedded planets be responsible for carving the gaps then their masses are at most a few 10 \{\{\{M\}\}\}{\textbackslash}oplus . The observed gaps are wider, with shallower flanks, than expected for planet-disk interaction with such low-mass planets. If forming planetary bodies have undergone collapse and are in the “detached phase,” then they may be directly observable with future facilities such as the Mid-Infrared E-ELT Imager and Spectrograph at the E-ELT.},

For different values of the amplitude and length scale of the bumps, we investigate the ability of this model to produce and retain large particles on million-year timescales. In addition, we compare the pressure inhomogeneities considered in this work with the pressure profiles that come from magnetorotational instability. Using the Common Astronomy Software Applications ALMA simulator, we study whether there are observational signatures of these pressure inhomogeneities that can be seen with ALMA. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We present the conditions required to trap dust particles and the corresponding calculations predicting the spectral slope in the mm-wavelength range, to compare with current observations. Finally, we present simulated images using different antenna configurations of ALMA at different frequencies, to show that the ring structures will be detectable at the distances of either the Taurus Auriga or Ophiucus star-forming regions.},

We review the possibility that planetesimals form when self-gravity brings together vast ensembles of small particles. Even when self-gravity is weak, aerodynamic processes can accumulate solids relative to gas, paving the way for gravitational collapse. Particles pile up as they drift radially inward. Gas turbulence stirs particles but can also seed collapse by clumping them. Whereas the feedback of solids on gas triggers vertical-shear instabilities that obstruct self-gravity, this same feedback triggers streaming instabilities that strongly concentrate particles. Numerical simulations find that solids ∼10-100 cm in size gravitationally collapse in turbulent disks. We outline areas for progress, including the possibility that still smaller objects self-gravitate.},

	abstract = {In performing a Bayesian analysis of astronomical data, two difficult problems often emerge. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the resulting posterior distribution may be multimodal or exhibit pronounced (curving) degeneracies, which can cause problems for traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods. Secondly, in selecting between a set of competing models, calculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally expensive using existing methods such as thermodynamic integration. The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling, has greatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidence and also produces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been applied successfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee, Parkinson \& Liddle, but their implementation was efficient only for unimodal distributions without pronounced degeneracies. Shaw, Bridges \& Hobson recently introduced a clustered nested sampling method which is significantly more efficient in sampling from multimodal posteriors and also determines the expectation and variance of the final evidence from a single run of the algorithm, hence providing a further increase in efficiency. In this paper, we build on the work of Shaw et al. and present three new methods for sampling and evidence evaluation from distributions that may contain multiple modes and significant degeneracies in very high dimensions; we also present an even more efficient technique for estimating the uncertainty on the evaluated evidence. These methods lead to a further substantial improvement in sampling efficiency and robustness, and are applied to two toy problems to demonstrate the accuracy and economy of the evidence calculation and parameter estimation. Finally, we discuss the use of these methods in performing Bayesian object detection in astronomical data sets, and show that they significantly outperform existing MCMC techniques. An implementation of our methods will be publicly released shortly.},

Our two detections are shown to be consistent when varying the reference star or reduction method used, and both detections exhibit structure out to projected distances of ≳200 au.

	abstract = {We describe Algorithms for Calibration, Optimized Registration, and Nulling the Star in Angular Differential Imaging (ACORNS-ADI), a new, parallelized software package to reduce high-contrast imaging data, and its application to data from the SEEDS survey. We implement several new algorithms, including a method to register saturated images, a trimmed mean for combining an image sequence that reduces noise by up to {\textasciitilde}20\%, and a robust and computationally fast method to compute the sensitivity of a high-contrast observation everywhere on the field of view without introducing artificial sources. We also include a description of image processing steps to remove electronic artifacts specific to Hawaii2-RG detectors like the one used for SEEDS, and a detailed analysis of the Locally Optimized Combination of Images (LOCI) algorithm commonly used to reduce high-contrast imaging data. ACORNS-ADI is written in python. It is efficient and open-source, and includes several optional features which may improve performance on data from other instruments. ACORNS-ADI requires minimal modification to reduce data from instruments other than HiCIAO. It is freely available for download at www.github.com/t-brandt/acorns-adi under a Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license.

We identify a total of 26 narrow rings and gaps distributed in 8 sources and 3 discs with small dust cavities (r {\textless}10 au). We find that two discs around embedded protostars lack the clear gaps and rings that are ubiquitous in more evolved sources with Class II SEDs. Our sample includes five objects with previously known large dust cavities (r {\textgreater}20 au). We find that the 1.3 mm radial profiles of these objects are in good agreement with those produced by numerical simulations of dust evolution and planet-disc interactions, which predict the accumulation of mm-sized grains at the edges of planet-induced cavities. Our long-baseline observations resulted in the largest sample of discs observed at ∼3-5 au resolution in any given star-forming region (15 objects when combined with Ophiuchus objects in the DSHARP Large Program) and allow for a demographic study of the brightest \${\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}! 5\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ of the discs in Ophiuchus (i.e. the most likely formation sites of giant planets in the cloud). We use this unique sample to propose an evolutionary sequence and discuss a scenario in which the substructures observed in massive protoplanetary discs are mainly the result of planet formation and dust evolution. If this scenario is correct, the detailed study of disc substructures might provide a window to investigate a population of planets that remains mostly undetectable by other techniques.},

This sample includes most mid-infrared excess members that were not previously imaged at high spatial resolution, excluding close binaries and objects with high extinction, thereby providing a more representative look at disk properties at 1-2 Myr. Our 1.3 mm continuum maps reveal 12 disks with prominent dust gaps and rings, 2 of which are around primary stars in wide binaries, and 20 disks with no resolved features at the observed resolution (hereafter smooth disks), 8 of which are around the primary star in wide binaries. The smooth disks were classified based on their lack of resolved substructures, but their most prominent property is that they are all compact with small effective emission radii (R eff,95\% ≲ 50 au). In contrast, all disks with R eff,95\% of at least 55 au in our sample show detectable substructures. Nevertheless, their inner emission cores (inside the resolved gaps) have similar peak brightness, power-law profiles, and transition radii to the compact smooth disks, so the primary difference between these two categories is the lack of outer substructures in the latter. These compact disks may lose their outer disk through fast radial drift without dust trapping, or they might be born with small sizes. The compact dust disks, as well as the inner disk cores of extended ring disks, that look smooth at the current resolution will likely show small-scale or low-contrast substructures at higher resolution. The correlation between disk size and disk luminosity correlation demonstrates that some of the compact disks are optically thick at millimeter wavelengths.},

	abstract = {The disks that orbit young stars are the essential conduits and reservoirs of material for star and planet formation. Their structures, meaning the spatial variations of the disk physical conditions, reflect the underlying mechanisms that drive those formation processes. Observations of the solids and gas in these disks, particularly at high resolution, provide fundamental insights on their mass distributions, dynamical states, and evolutionary behaviors. Over the past decade, rapid developments in these areas have largely been driven by observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This review highlights the state of observational research on disk structures, emphasizing the following three key conclusions that reflect the main branches of the field: Relationships among disk structure properties are also linked to the masses, environments, and evolutionary states of their stellar hosts. There is clear, qualitative evidence for the growth and migration of disk solids, although the implied evolutionary timescales suggest the classical assumption of a smooth gas disk is inappropriate. Small-scale substructures with a variety of morphologies, locations, scales, and amplitudes—presumably tracing local gas pressure maxima—broadly influence the physical and observational properties of disks.The last point especially is reshaping the field, with the recognition that these disk substructures likely trace active sites of planetesimal growth or are the hallmarks of planetary systems at their formation epoch.},

	abstract = {The detection of a wide range of substructures such as rings, cavities, and spirals has become a common outcome of high spatial resolution imaging of protoplanetary disks, both in the near-infrared scattered light and in the thermal millimetre continuum emission. The most frequent interpretation of their origin is the presence of planetary-mass companions perturbing the gas and dust distribution in the disk (perturbers), but so far the only bona fide detection has been the two giant planets carving the disk around PDS 70. Here, we present a sample of 15 protoplanetary disks showing substructures in SPHERE scattered-light images and a homogeneous derivation of planet detection limits in these systems. To obtain mass limits we rely on different post-formation luminosity models based on distinct formation conditions, which are critical in the first million years of evolution. We also estimate the mass of these perturbers through a Hill radius prescription and a comparison to ALMA data. Assuming that one single planet carves each substructure in scattered light, we find that more massive perturbers are needed to create gaps within cavities than rings, and that we might be close to a detection in the cavities of RX J1604.3-2130A, RX J1615.3-3255, Sz Cha, HD 135344B, and HD 34282. We reach typical mass limits in these cavities of 3-10 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. For planets in the gaps between rings, we find that the detection limits of SPHERE high-contrast imaging are about an order of magnitude away in mass, and that the gaps of PDS 66 and HD 97048 seem to be the most promising structures for planet searches. The proposed presence of massive planets causing spiral features in HD 135344B and HD 36112 are also within SPHERE's reach assuming hot-start models. These results suggest that the current detection limits are able to detect hot-start planets in cavities, under the assumption that they are formed by a single perturber located at the centre of the cavity. More realistic planet mass constraints would help to clarify whether this is actually the case, which might indicate that perturbers are not the only way of creating substructures.},

	abstract = {The nearby Herbig Be star HD 100546 is known to be a laboratory for the study of protoplanets and their relation with the circumstellar disk, which is carved by at least two gaps. We observed the HD 100546 environment with high-contrast imaging exploiting several different observing modes of SPHERE, including data sets with and without coronagraphs, dual band imaging, integral field spectroscopy and polarimetry. The picture emerging from these different data sets is complex. Flux-conservative algorithm images clearly show the disk up to 200 au. More aggressive algorithms reveal several rings and warped arms that are seen overlapping the main disk. Some of these structures are found to lie at considerable height over the disk mid-plane at about 30 au. Our images demonstrate that the brightest wings close to the star in the near side of the disk are a unique structure, corresponding to the outer edge of the intermediate disk at {\textasciitilde} 40 au. Modeling of the scattered light from the disk with a geometrical algorithm reveals that a moderately thin structure ({\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}∕{\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.18 at 40 au) can well reproduce the light distribution in the flux-conservative images. We suggest that the gap between 44 and 113 au spans between the 1:2 and 3:2 resonance orbits of a massive body located at {\textasciitilde} 70 au, which mightcoincide with the candidate planet HD 100546b detected with previous thermal infrared (IR) observations. In this picture, the two wings can be the near side of a ring formed by disk material brought out of the disk at the 1:2 resonance with the same massive object. While we find no clear evidence confirming detection of the planet candidate HD 100546c in our data, we find a diffuse emission close to the expected position of HD 100546b. This source can be described as an extremely reddened substellar object surrounded by a dust cloud or its circumplanetary disk. Its astrometry is broadly consistent with a circular orbital motion on the disk plane, a result that could be confirmed with new observations. Further observations at various wavelengths are required to fully understand the complex phenomenology of HD 100546.},

	abstract = {Context. During the evolution of protoplanetary disks into planetary systems we expect to detect signatures that trace mechanisms such as planet-disk interaction. Protoplanetary disks display a large variety of structures in recently published high-spatial resolution images. However, the three-dimensional morphology of these disks is often difficult to infer from the two-dimensional projected images we observe. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to detect signatures of planet-disk interaction by studying the scattering surface of the protoplanetary disk around HD 34282. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We spatially resolved the disk using the high-contrast imager VLT/SPHERE in polarimetric imaging mode. We retrieved a profile for the height of the scattering surface to create a height-corrected deprojection, which simulates a face-on orientation. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The detected disk displays a complex scattering surface. An inner clearing or cavity extending up to r \&lt; 0."28 (88 au) is surrounded by a bright inclined (i = 56°) ring with a position angle of 119°. The center of this ring is offset from the star along the minor axis with 0."07, which can be explained with a disk height of 26 au above the midplane. Outside this ring, beyond its southeastern ansa we detect an azimuthal asymmetry or blob at r {\textasciitilde} 0."4. At larger separation, we detect an outer disk structure that can be fitted with an ellipse, which is compatible with a circular ring seen at r = 0."62 (=190 au) and a height of 77 au. After applying a height-corrected deprojection we see a circular ring centered on the star at 88 au; what had seemed to be a separate blob and outer ring could now both be part of a single-armed spiral. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We present the first scattered-light image of the disk around HD 34282 and resolve a disk with an inner cavity up to r ≈ 90 au and a highly structured scattering surface of an inclined disk at a large height H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}scat{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}∕r = 0."29 above the midplane at the inner edge of the outer disk.

The mechanisms causing these structures are still under debate. A popular scenario to drive the spiral arms is the one of a planet perturbing the material in the disk. However, if the disk is massive, gravitational instability isusually the favored explanation. Multiwavelength studies could be helpful to distinguish between the two scenarios. So far, only a handful of disks with spiral arms have been observed in both scattered light and millimeter continuum.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We aim to perform an in-depth characterization of the protoplanetary disk morphology around WaOph 6 analyzing data obtained at different wavelengths, as well as to investigate the origin of the spiral features in the disk.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We present the first near-infrared polarimetric observations of WaOph 6 obtained with SPHERE at the VLT and compare them to archival millimeter continuum ALMA observations. We traced the spiral features in both data sets and estimated the respective pitch angles. We discuss the different scenarios that can give rise to the spiral arms in WaOph 6. We tested the planetary perturber hypothesis by performing hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations to compare them with scattered light and millimeter continuum observations.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We confirm that the spiral structure is present in our polarized scattered light {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band observationsof WaOph 6, making it the youngest disk with spiral arms detected at these wavelengths. From the comparison to the millimeter ALMA-DSHARP observations, we confirm that the disk is flared.

	abstract = {Many high-contrast coronagraph designs have recently been proposed. In this paper, their suitability for direct imaging of extrasolar terrestrial planets is reviewed. We also develop a linear algebra based model of coronagraphy that can both explain the behavior of existing coronagraphs and quantify the coronagraphic performance limit imposed by fundamental physics. We find that the maximum theoretical throughput of a coronagraph is equal to 1 minus the nonaberrated noncoronagraphic PSF of the telescope. We describe how a coronagraph reaching this fundamental limit may be designed, and how much improvement over the best existing coronagraph design is still possible. Both the analytical model and numerical simulations of existing designs also show that this theoretical limit rapidly degrades as the source size is increased: the ``highest performance'' coronagraphs, those with the highest throughput and smallest inner working angle (IWA), are the most sensitive to stellar angular diameter. This unfortunately rules out the possibility of using a small IWA ({\textless}λ/d) coronagraph for a terrestrial planet imaging mission. Finally, a detailed numerical simulation that accurately accounts for stellar angular size, zodiacal and exozodiacal light is used to quantify the efficiency of coronagraph designs for direct imaging of extrasolar terrestrial planets in a possible real observing program. We find that in the photon noise-limited regime, a 4 m telescope with a theoretically optimal coronagraph is able to detect Earth-like planets around 50 stars with 1 hr exposure time per target (assuming 25\% throughput and exozodi levels similar to our solar system). We also show that at least two existing coronagraph design can approach this level of performance in the ideal monochromatic case considered in this study.},

	abstract = {Recent observations of the NN Serpentis post-common envelope binary system have revealed eclipse timing variations that have been attributed to the presence of two Jovian-mass exo-planets. Under the assumption that these planets are real and survived from the binary's main-sequence state, we reconstruct initial binaries that give rise to the present NN Ser configuration and test the dynamical stability of the original system. Under standard assumptions about binary evolution, we find that survival of the planets through the entire main-sequence lifetime is very unlikely. Hence, we conclude that the planets are not survivors from before the common envelope phase, implying that either they formed recently out of material ejected from the primary or that the observed signals are of non-planetary origin.},

	abstract = {Context. Heavy metals in the atmospheres of white dwarfs are thought in many cases to be accreted from a circumstellar debris disk, which was formed by the tidal disruption of a rocky planetary body within the Roche radius of the star. The abundance analysis of photospheric elements and conclusions about the chemical composition of the accreted matter are a new and promising method of studying the composition of extrasolar planetary systems. However, ground-based searches for metal-polluted white dwarfs that rely primarily on the detection of the Ca ii K line become insensitive at T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 15 000 K because this ionization state depopulates. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We present the results of the first unbiased survey for metal pollution among hydrogen-atmosphere (DA type) white dwarfs with cooling ages in the range 20-200 Myr and 17 000 K \&lt;T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 27 000 K. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The sample was observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope in the far ultraviolet range between 1130 and 1435 Å. The atmospheric parameters were obtained using these spectra and optical observations from the literature. Element abundances were determined using theoretical models, which include the effects of element stratification due to gravitational settling and radiative levitation. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find 48 of the 85 DA white dwarfs studied, or 56\% show traces of heavy elements. In 25 stars (showing only Si and occasionally C), the elements can be explained by radiative levitation alone, although we argue that accretion has very likely occurred recently. The remaining 23 white dwarfs (27\%), however, must be currently accreting. Together with previous studies from the ground and adopting bulk Earth abundances for the debris, accretion rates range from a few 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} g s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} to a few 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}8{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} g s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, with no evident trend in cooling age from ≈40 Myr to ≈2 Gyr. Only a single, modest case of metal pollution (Ṁ \&lt; 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} g s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) is found among ten white dwarfs with T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 23 000 K, in excellent agreement with the absence of infrared excess from dust around these warmer stars. The median, main sequence progenitor of our sample corresponds to an A-type star of ≈2 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and we find 13 of 23 white dwarfs descending from main sequence 2-3 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, late B- and A-type stars to be currently accreting. Only one of 14 targets with M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}wd{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 0.8 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is found to be currently accreting, which suggests a large fraction of these stars result from double-degenerate mergers, and the merger disks do not commonly reform large planetesimals or otherwise pollute the remnant. We reconfirm our previous finding that two 625 Myr Hyades white dwarfs are currently accreting rocky planetary debris. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: At least 27\% of all white dwarfs with cooling ages 20-200 Myr are accreting planetary debris, but that fraction could be as high as ≈50\%. At T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 23 000 K, the luminosity of white dwarfs is probably sufficient to vaporize circumstellar dust grains, so no stars with strong metal-pollution are found. Planetesimal disruption events should occur in this cooling age and temperature range as well, and they are likely to result in short phases of high mass-transfer rates. It appears that the formation of rocky planetary material is common around 2-3 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} late B- and A-type stars. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Table 1 is available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201423691/olm"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

Extensive pedagogical tutorials, intended to be navigable by both orbit-fitting novices and seasoned experts, are available on our documentation page. We have designed the orbitize! API to be flexible and easy to use/modify for unique cases. orbitize! was designed by members of the exoplanet imaging community to be a central repository for algorithms, techniques, and know-how developed by this community. We intend for it to continue to expand and change as the field progresses and new techniques are developed, and call for community involvement in this process.

	abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}{\textless}A href="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia"{\textgreater}http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Traditional thermal evolution models of giant planets employ arbitrary initial conditions selected more for computational expediency than physical accuracy. Since the initial conditions are eventually forgotten by the evolving planet, this approach is valid for mature planets, if not young ones. To explore the evolution at young ages of jovian mass planets, we have employed model planets created by one implementation of the core-accretion mechanism as initial conditions for evolutionary calculations. The luminosities and early cooling rates of young planets are highly sensitive to their internal entropies, which depend on the formation mechanism and are highly model dependent. As a result of the accretion shock through which most of the planetary mass is processed, we find lower initial internal entropies than commonly assumed in published evolution tracks. Consequently, young Jovian planets are smaller, cooler, and several to 100 times less luminous than predicted by earlier models. Furthermore, the time interval during which the young Jupiters are fainter than expected depends on the mass of planet. Jupiter mass planets (1MJ) align with the conventional model luminosity in as little at 20 million years, but 10MJ planets can take up to 1 billion years to match commonly cited luminosities, given our implementation of the core-accretion mechanism. If our assumptions, especially including our treatment of the accretion shock, are correct and if extrasolar Jovian planets indeed form with low entropy, then young Jovian planets are substantially fainter at young ages than currently believed. Furthermore, early evolution tracks should be regarded as uncertain for much longer than the commonly quoted 106 yr. These results have important consequences both for detection strategies and for assigning masses to young Jovian planets based on observed luminosities.},

They also inform on co-orbiting (but unseen) planets, the systemic architectures, and forces perturbing the starlight-scattering circumstellar material. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) broadband optical coronagraphy, we have completed the observational phase of a program to study the spatial distribution of dust in a sample of 10 circumstellar debris systems and 1 "mature" protoplanetrary disk, all with HST pedigree, using point-spread-function-subtracted multi-roll coronagraphy. These observations probe stellocentric distances {\textgreater}=5 AU for the nearest systems, and simultaneously resolve disk substructures well beyond corresponding to the giant planet and Kuiper Belt regions within our own solar system. They also disclose diffuse very low-surface-brightness dust at larger stellocentric distances. Herein we present new results inclusive of fainter disks such as HD 92945 (F disk/F star = 5 × 10-5), confirming, and better revealing, the existence of a narrow inner debris ring within a larger diffuse dust disk. Other disks with ring-like substructures and significant asymmetries and complex morphologies include HD 181327, for which we posit a spray of ejecta from a recent massive collision in an exo-Kuiper Belt; HD 61005, suggested to be interacting with the local interstellar medium; and HD 15115 and HD 32297, also discussed in the context of putative environmental interactions. These disks and HD 15745 suggest that debris system evolution cannot be treated in isolation. For AU Mic's edge-on disk, we find out-of-plane surface brightness asymmetries at {\textgreater}=5 AU that may implicate the existence of one or more planetary perturbers. Time-resolved images of the MP Mus protoplanetary disk provide spatially resolved temporal variability in the disk illumination. These and other new images from our HST/STIS GO/12228 program enable direct inter-comparison of the architectures of these exoplanetary debris systems in the context of our own solar system.},

	abstract = {A renewal of interest into Lyot coronagraphy began about 10 years ago with the advent of the new and very demanding goal of detecting directly extrasolar planets. Among the new ideas, the Four Quadrant Phase Mask (4QPMC) has been rather prolific. The 4QPM coronagraph is based the peculiar design of binary phase mask (0,π) dividing the full field of view at the focal plane in four quadrants. The mutual destructive interferences of the coherent light of a source perfectly centered on the mask, produce a total nulling within the pupil image, as is demonstrated analytically. We first recall the concept and performance of the 4QPMC. We then analyse the different limitations in space or ground-based observations from simulations. We then address the issue of device manufacturing and give the status of the actual performance in laboratory. A section reviews the various instruments under development that are equipped with this component. We conclude with a panorama of the rest of the family of the 4QPMC, which comprises several variants proposed by different teams. More specifically we address the important question of the achromatization by describing the various ideas which are currently explored to solve this problem. Among them, some genuine ones, not yet published, are presented. To cite this article: D. Rouan et al., C. R. Physique 8 (2007).
Résumé
Un renouveau d'intérêt pour la coronagraphie de Lyot s'est fait jour il y a environ 10 ans avec l'émergence du but nouveau mais très exigeant de détecter directement les planètes extrasolaires. Parmi les nouvelles idées, celle du masque de phase à quatre quadrants (4QPMC) s'est montrée assez prolifique. Le coronagraphe 4QPM est basé sur le concept particulier d'un masque binaire de phase (0,π) divisant le champ dans le plan focal suivant quatre quadrants. Les interférences destructives mutuelles de la lumière d'une source cohérente parfaitement centrée sur le masque produit une annulation totale dans l'image de pupille, comme on le démontre analytiquement. Nous rappelons d'abord le concept et les performances du 4QPMC. Nous analysons ensuite les différentes limitations des observations depuis l'espace ou du sol par des simulations, puis nous abordons la question de la fabrication du dispositif et donnons le statut des performances obtenues au laboratoire. Une revue est faite des instruments en cours de développement équipés de ce composant. Nous concluons avec un panorama du reste de la famille du 4QPMC qui comporte plusieurs variantes proposées par différentes équipes. Plus spécifiquement nous traitons la question importante de l'achromatisation avec une description des diverses idées qui sont actuellement explorées pour résoudre le problème. Parmi elles, quelques innovations, pas encore publiées, sont présentées. Pour citer cet article : D. Rouan et al., C. R. Physique 8 (2007).},

We present proof-of-principle experimental results in the visible, using a transmissive twisted nematic liquid crystal SLM display to show that SLMs can be successfully implemented as focal-plane phase-mask coronagraphs (4QPM, 8OPM,...), and that the technology is essentially in place to address realistic instrumental configurations. We explore a specific application where SLM-based adaptive coronagraphy might be particularly competitive, which is direct imaging of multiple stars systems, by simultaneously nulling multiple point sources in the field. Using a simple approach to compute a brightness-weighted synthetized coronagraphic phase map, we show that in the case of binaries the contrast gain over using a regular phase map can exceed 4 stellar magnitudes for a 1:1 binaries down to separation as close as 1 \&lambda;/D. Thanks to video-rate update frequency of the SLM, the technique is in principle compatible with sky rotation in the case of altitude-azimuth telescope mounts, and can address multiple target configurations with no actual mechanical or hardware change.},

	abstract = {The presence of planets around solar-type stars suggests that many white dwarfs should have relic planetary systems. While planets closer than {\textasciitilde}5 AU will most likely not survive the post-main-sequence lifetime of their parent star, any planet with semimajor axis greater than 5 AU will survive, and its semimajor axis will increase as the central star loses mass. Since the stability of adjacent orbits to mutual planet-planet perturbations depends on the ratio of the planet mass to the central star's mass, some planets in previously stable orbits around a star undergoing mass loss will become unstable. We show that when mass loss is slow, systems of two planets that are marginally stable can become unstable to close encounters, while for three planets the timescale for close approaches decreases significantly with increasing mass ratio. These processes could explain the presence of anomalous IR excesses around white dwarfs that cannot be explained by close companions, such as G29-38, and may also be an important factor in explaining the existence of DAZ white dwarfs. The onset of instability through changing mass ratios will also be a significant effect for planetary embryos gaining mass in protoplanetary disks.},

	abstract = {Context: Many binary stellar systems in which the primary star is beyond the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolutionary phase show significant orbital eccentricities, whereas current binary interaction models predict that their orbits are circularised. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Aims: In the search for a mechanism to counteract the circularising effect of tidal interaction, we analyse how the orbital parameters in a system are modified under mass loss and mass exchange among its binary components. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: We propose a model for enhanced mass loss from the AGB star due to tidal interaction with its companion, which allows a smooth transition between the wind and Roche-lobe overflow mass loss regimes. We explicitly follow its effect along the orbit on the change in eccentricity and orbital semi-major axis, as well as the effect of accretion by the companion. We calculate timescales for the variation in these orbital parameters and compare them to the tidal circularisation timescale. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: We find that in many cases, due to the enhanced mass loss of the AGB component at orbital phases closer to the periastron, the net eccentricity growth rate in one orbit is comparable to the rate of tidal circularisation. We show that with this eccentricity-enhancing mechanism it is possible to reproduce the orbital period and eccentricity of the Sirius system, which is expected to be circularised under the standard assumptions of binary interaction. We also show that this mechanism may provide an explanation for the eccentricities of most barium star systems, which are expected to be circularised due to tidal dissipation. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Conclusions: By proposing a tidally enhanced model of mass loss from AGB stars, we find a mechanism that efficiently works against the tidal circularisation of the orbit. This mechanism can explain the significant eccentricities observed in binary systems containing a white dwarf and a less evolved companion, which are predicted to be circularised due to their proximity, such as Sirius and systems with barium stars.},

	abstract = {Gas-giant planets that form via core accretion might have very different characteristics from those that form via disk instability. Disk-instability objects are typically thought to have higher entropies, larger radii, and (generally) higher effective temperatures than core-accretion objects. In this paper, we provide a large set of models exploring the observational consequences of high-entropy (hot) and low-entropy (cold) initial conditions, in the hope that this will ultimately help to distinguish between different physical mechanisms of planet formation. However, the exact entropies and radii of newly formed planets due to these two modes of formation cannot, at present, be precisely predicted. It is possible that the distribution of properties of core-accretion-formed planets and the distribution of properties of disk-instability-formed planets overlap. We, therefore, introduce a broad range of "warm-start" gas-giant planet models. Between the hottest and the coldest models that we consider, differences in radii, temperatures, luminosities, and spectra persist for only a few million to a few tens of millions of years for planets that are a few times Jupiter's mass or less. For planets that are {\textasciitilde}five times Jupiter's mass or more, significant differences between hottest-start and coldest-start models persist for on the order of 100 Myr. We find that out of the standard infrared bands (J, H, K, L', M, N) the K and H bands are the most diagnostic of the initial conditions. A hottest-start model can be from {\textasciitilde}4.5 mag brighter (at Jupiter's mass) to {\textasciitilde}9 mag brighter (at 10 times Jupiter's mass) than a coldest-start model in the first few million years. In more massive objects, these large differences in luminosity and spectrum persist for much longer than in less massive objects. Finally, we consider the influence of atmospheric conditions on spectra, and find that the presence or absence of clouds, and the metallicity of an atmosphere, can affect an object's apparent brightness in different bands by up to several magnitudes.},

	abstract = {Studies1,2 have shown that the remnants of destroyed planets and debris-disk planetesimals can survive the volatile evolution of their host stars into white dwarfs3,4, but few intact planetary bodies around white dwarfs have been detected5–8. Simulations predict9–11 that planets in Jupiter-like orbits around stars of ≲8 M☉ (solar mass) avoid being destroyed by the strong tidal forces of their stellar host, but as yet, there has been no observational confirmation of such a survivor. Here we report the non-detection of a main-sequence lens star in the microlensing event MOA-2010-BLG-477Lb12 using near-infrared observations from the Keck Observatory. We determine that this system contains a 0.53 ± 0.11 M☉ white-dwarf host orbited by a 1.4 ± 0.3 Jupiter-mass planet with a separation on the plane of the sky of 2.8 ± 0.5 astronomical units, which implies a semi-major axis larger than this. This system is evidence that planets around white dwarfs can survive the giant and asymptotic giant phases of their host’s evolution, and supports the prediction that more than half of white dwarfs have Jovian planetary companions13. Located at approximately 2.0 kiloparsecs towards the centre of our Galaxy, it is likely to represent an analogue to the end stages of the Sun and Jupiter in our own Solar System.},

	abstract = {Identifying planets around O-type and B-type stars is inherently difficult; the most massive known planet host has a mass of only about \$3{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ . However, planetary systems which survive the transformation of their host stars into white dwarfs can be detected via photospheric trace metals, circumstellar dusty and gaseous discs, and transits of planetary debris crossing our line of sight. These signatures offer the potential to explore the efficiency of planet formation for host stars with masses up to the core-collapse boundary at \${\textbackslash}approx 8{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ , a mass regime rarely investigated in planet formation theory. Here, we establish limits on where both major and minor planets must reside around \${\textbackslash}approx 6{\textbackslash}rm \{-\}8{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ stars in order to survive into the white dwarf phase. For this mass range, we find that intact terrestrial or giant planets need to leave the main sequence beyond approximate minimum star-planet separations of, respectively, about 3 and 6 au. In these systems, rubble pile minor planets of radii 10, 1.0, and 0.1 km would have been shorn apart by giant branch radiative YORP spin-up if they formed and remained within, respectively, tens, hundreds, and thousands of au. These boundary values would help distinguish the nature of the progenitor of metal pollution in white dwarf atmospheres. We find that planet formation around the highest mass white dwarf progenitors may be feasible, and hence encourage both dedicated planet formation investigations for these systems and spectroscopic analyses of the highest mass white dwarfs.},

	abstract = {Exo-planets are typically thought to form in protoplanetary disks left over from protostellar disk of their newly formed host star. However, additional planetary formation and evolution routes may exist in old evolved binary systems. Here we discuss the implications of binary stellar evolution on planetary systems in such environments. In these binary systems stellar evolution could lead to the formation of symbiotic stars, where mass is lost from one star and could be transferred to its binary companion, and may form an accretion disk around it. This raises the possibility that such a disk could provide the necessary environment for the formation of a new, second generation of planets in both circumstellar or circumbinary configurations. Pre-existing first generation planets surviving the post-MS evolution of such systems would be dynamically effected by the mass loss in the systems and may also interact with the newly formed disk. Such planets and/or planetesimals may also serve as seeds for the formation of the second generation planets, and/or interact with them, possibly forming atypical planetary systems. Second generation planetary systems should be typically found in white dwarf binary systems, and may show various observational signatures. Most notably, second generation planets could form in environment which are inaccessible, or less favorable, for first generation planets. The orbital phase space available for the second generation planets could be forbidden (in terms of the system stability) to first generation planets in the pre-evolved progenitor binaries. In addition planets could form in metal poor environments such as globular clusters and/or in double compact object binaries. Observations of exo-planets in such forbidden or unfavorable regions could possibly serve to uniquely identify their second generation character. Finally, we point out a few observed candidate second generation planetary systems, including Gl 86, HD 27442 and all of the currently observed circumbinary planet candidates. A second generation origin for these systems could naturally explain their unique configurations.},

	abstract = {The search for planets around white dwarf stars, and evidence for dynamical instability around them in the form of atmospheric pollution and circumstellar disks, raises questions about the nature of planetary systems that can survive the vicissitudes of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). We study the competing effects, on planets at several AU from the star, of strong tidal forces arising from the star's large convective envelope, and of the planets' orbital expansion due to stellar mass loss. We study, for the first time, the evolution of planets while following each thermal pulse on the AGB. For Jovian planets, tidal forces are strong, and can pull into the envelope planets initially at {\textasciitilde}3 AU for a 1 M ⊙ star and {\textasciitilde}5 AU for a 5 M ⊙ star. Lower-mass planets feel weaker tidal forces, and terrestrial planets initially within 1.5-3 AU enter the stellar envelope. Thus, low-mass planets that begin inside the maximum stellar radius can survive, as their orbits expand due to mass loss. The inclusion of a moderate planetary eccentricity slightly strengthens the tidal forces experienced by Jovian planets. Eccentric terrestrial planets are more at risk, since their eccentricity does not decay and their small pericenter takes them inside the stellar envelope. We also find the closest radii at which planets will be found around white dwarfs, assuming that any planet entering the stellar envelope is destroyed. Planets are in that case unlikely to be found inside {\textasciitilde}1.5 AU of a white dwarf with a 1 M ⊙ progenitor and {\textasciitilde}10 AU of a white dwarf with a 5 M ⊙ progenitor.},

	shorttitle = {Sonora {Bobcat}},
	url = {https://zenodo.org/record/5063476},
	abstract = {OVERVIEW Presented here are models for non-irradiated, substellar mass objects belonging to the Sonora model series, described in Marley et al. (2021). The files presented here are model temperature-pressure structures ("structure"), emergent spectra from the top of the atmosphere ("spectra"), thermal evolution and photometry ("evolution\_and\_photometry"), and rainout chemical equilibrium tables used to compute the models ("chemistry").  Atmospheric structure and spectra .tar file names specify metallicity [M/H] and carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) relative to solar. For example, "structures+0.0\_co1.5.tar.gz" contains the set of radiative-convective equilibrium atmospheric structures for solar metallicity ("+0.0") with C/O=1.5 times the solar abundance. The \_co*.* is omitted for solar C/O, or co\_1.0. The individual file naming convention is described below. All stated abundances and ratios are relative to Lodders (2010) abundances, see Marley et al. (2021) for details and use caution when referring to other abundance tabulations. This particular set of model atmosphere structures and associated spectra, photometry, and evolution, which we name Sonora Bobcat, are for cloudless objects with 3.25 ≤ log g (cgs) ≤ 5.5 and 200 ≤ Teff ≤ 2400K. Steps in Teff vary from 25K to 1000K and steps in log g are 0.25 or 0.5. Some combinations of model grid parameters include additional values of the gravity.  Models are provided for [M/H] = -0.5, 0.0, and +0.5 and "rainout" chemical equilibrium. A limited set of models with carbon-to-oxygen ratio of 0.5 and 1.5 times solar abundance are also included. For the convenience of having a rectangular table in (Teff, gravity) space, models are calculated in regimes that are not reached by the evolution, such as very high gravity and very low Teff. Refer to the companion evolution tables to identify combinations of Teff and log g outside the bounds covered by the evolution. ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE Atmospheric structure and spectra filenames specify Teff and gravity (in mks units) along with [M/H] and (C/O) relative to solar. "co1.5" in version and spectra header nomenclature refers to 1.5 times the solar C/O ratio. \_co*.* is generally omitted for 1.0, the solar value. For example, the file t1000g316nc\_m-0.5.dat contains the structure of a model with  Teff=1000K, g=316m/s2 (the exact value of the gravity is given in the first line of the file, see below) , [Fe/H]=-0.5, and C/O=1.0 times the solar value.  Temperature structure and spectra files have a one line header giving "Teff, grav(MKS), Y, f\_sed, kz\_min, [Fe/H], C/O, f\_hole". Teff and grav are the effective temperature (K) and gravity (MKS), Y is the He mass fraction. f\_sed is a cloud parameterization which is not relevant for these cloudless models and is arbitrarily given as 0.0. Likewise kz\_min relates to the atmospheric eddy diffusion coefficient, which is also not relevant for these chemical equilibrium models and is arbitrarily set equal to a placeholder value that is not used in these models. [Fe/H] and C/O are the metallicity and C/O ratios as described above. [Fe/H] is identical to [M/H]. f\_hole is another cloud parameter for cloudy models, not relevant to these cloudless models. Columns in the atmosphere structure files describe the atmosphere at discrete levels. Columns give: level index, P(bar), T(K), internally used check parameter, adiabatic temperature gradient (d ln T / d ln P), local temperature gradient (d ln T / d ln P), atmospheric density (g / cm3). EVOLUTION AND PHOTOMETRY Evolution and Photometry tables are described in detail in a README file included in that tar file. Evolution files connect mass, effective temperature, radius, age, gravity, and moment of inertia for these model sets. Each set of model spectra is complemented with tables of fluxes and of absolute magnitudes in a number of photometric systems commonly used in brown dwarf and exoplanet research (MKO, Keck, 2MASS, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer IRAC, etc).  Fluxes and magnitudes for the full set of JWST filters is also included in separate tables.  Magnitudes are computed on the Vega system (using the Vega spectrum of Bohlin \& Gilliland 2004) or on the AB system (e.g. for SDSS). SPECTRA The model spectra each contain close to 362000 wavelength points. The resolving power varies with wavelength and ranges from R=6000 to 200000 but is otherwise the same for all spectra. The first line gives the model parameters in the same format as the structure files described above. This is followed by the spectrum Column 1: wavelength in µm Column 2:  Eddington flux Fν in erg/cm2/s/Hz (exercise caution with factors of {\textbackslash}(4{\textbackslash}pi{\textbackslash}) when comparing to the radiation flux, e.g., see Section 3.3 of Hubeny \& Mihalas, "Theory of Stellar Atmospheres") The spectral fluxes are given at the top of the atmosphere and are strictly monochromatic. The model spectrum provides no information in the wavelength range between two tabulated points. Unless a spectral line or feature is well resolved, interpolation in wavelength is not advised.  For comparison with data, the model spectra need to be convolved and binned to the instrumental resolution and sampling. In our experience, a minimum of 10 wavelength points is necessary to obtain a reasonable average flux over a wavelength interval. This is a rule of thumb and caution is advised, especially when comparing with high resolution data. The flux received at Earth is that given in the table scaled by (R/D)2  where R is the radius of the object (given in the companion evolution tables) and D its distance.  The solar spectra and photometry are the same as those archived at https://zenodo.org/record/1309035\#.YOyz4S1h2X0, which did not provide the T(P) profiles available here. CHEMISTRY We also separately include rainout chemical equilibrium tables for these same atmospheric bulk abundances. These chemistry files are described in detail by their own README file. Additional chemistry tables, beyond those used for the models presented here, are also included for completeness. Users interested in the chemical abundances of the structure models must interpolate within the matching chemistry file for the atmospheric species of interest.

	abstract = {Many planets are observed in stellar binary systems, and their frequency may be comparable to that of planetary systems around single stars. Binary stellar evolution in such systems influences the dynamical evolution of the resident planets. Here, we study the evolution of a single planet orbiting one star in an evolving binary system. We find that stellar evolution can trigger dynamical instabilities that drive planets into chaotic orbits. This instability leads to planet-star collisions, exchange of the planet between the binary stars ("star hoppers"), and ejection of the planet from the system. The means by which planets can be recaptured is similar to the pull-down capture mechanism for irregular solar system satellites. Because planets often suffer close encounters with the primary on the asymptotic giant branch, captures during a collision with the stellar envelope are also possible for more massive planets. Such capture could populate the habitable zone around white dwarfs.},

	abstract = {We present the initial-final mass relation (IFMR) based on the self-consistent analysis of Sirius B and 79 white dwarfs from 13 star clusters. We have also acquired additional signal on eight white dwarfs previously analyzed in the NGC 2099 cluster field, four of which are consistent with membership. These re-observed white dwarfs have masses ranging from 0.72 to 0.97 M ⊙, with initial masses from 3.0 to 3.65 M ⊙, where the IFMR has an important change in slope that these new data help to observationally confirm. In total, this directly measured IFMR has small scatter (σ = 0.06 M ⊙) and spans from progenitors of 0.85 to 7.5 M ⊙. Applying two different stellar evolutionary models to infer two different sets of white dwarf progenitor masses shows that, when the same model is also used to derive the cluster ages, the resulting IFMR has weak sensitivity to the adopted model at all but the highest initial masses ({\textgreater}5.5 M ⊙). The nonlinearity of the IFMR is also clearly observed with moderate slopes at lower masses (0.08 M final/M initial) and higher masses (0.11 M final/M initial) that are broken up by a steep slope (0.19 M final/M initial) between progenitors from 2.85 to 3.6 M ⊙. This IFMR shows total stellar mass loss ranges from 33\% of M initial at 0.83 M ⊙ to 83\% of M initial at 7.5 M ⊙. Testing this total mass loss for dependence on progenitor metallicity, however, finds no detectable sensitivity across the moderate range of -0.15 {\textless} [Fe/H] {\textless} +0.15.

	abstract = {We present a new set of solar metallicity atmosphere and evolutionary models for very cool brown dwarfs and self-luminous giant exoplanets, which we term ATMO 2020. Atmosphere models are generated with our state-of-the-art 1D radiative-convective equilibrium code ATMO, and are used as surface boundary conditions to calculate the interior structure and evolution of 0.001-0.075 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} objects. Our models include several key improvements to the input physics used in previous models available in the literature. Most notably, the use of a new H-He equation of state including ab initio quantum molecular dynamics calculations has raised the mass by {\textasciitilde}1-2\% at the stellar-substellar boundary and has altered the cooling tracks around the hydrogen and deuterium burning minimum masses. A second key improvement concerns updated molecular opacities in our atmosphere model ATMO, which now contains significantly more line transitions required to accurately capture the opacity in these hot atmospheres. This leads to warmer atmospheric temperature structures, further changing the cooling curves and predicted emission spectra of substellar objects. We present significant improvement for the treatment of the collisionally broadened potassium resonance doublet, and highlight the importance of these lines in shaping the red-optical and near-infrared spectrum of brown dwarfs. We generate three different grids of model simulations, one using equilibrium chemistry and two using non-equilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing, all three computed self-consistently with the pressure-temperature structure of the atmosphere. We show the impact of vertical mixing on emission spectra and in colour-magnitude diagrams, highlighting how the 3.5-5.5 μm flux window can be used to calibrate vertical mixing in cool T-Y spectral type objects.},

	abstract = {Physical collisions and close approaches between stars play an important role in the formation of exotic stellar systems. Standard theories suggest that collisions are rare, occurring only via random encounters between stars in dense clusters. We present a different formation pathway, the triple evolution dynamical instability (TEDI), in which mass loss in an evolving triple star system causes orbital instability. The subsequent chaotic orbital evolution of the stars triggers close encounters, collisions, exchanges between the stellar components, and the dynamical formation of eccentric compact binaries (including Sirius-like binaries). We demonstrate that the rate of stellar collisions due to the TEDI is approximately 10-4 yr-1 per Milky Way Galaxy, which is nearly 30 times higher than the total collision rate due to random encounters in the Galactic globular clusters. Moreover, we find that the dominant type of stellar collision is qualitatively different; most collisions involve asymptotic giant branch stars, rather than main sequence or slightly evolved stars, which dominate collisions in globular clusters. The TEDI mechanism should lead us to revise our understanding of collisions and the formation of compact, eccentric binaries in the field.},

	abstract = {Astronomers have discovered thousands of planets outside the Solar System1, most of which orbit stars that will eventually evolve into red giants and then into white dwarfs. During the red giant phase, any close-orbiting planets will be engulfed by the star2, but more distant planets can survive this phase and remain in orbit around the white dwarf3,4. Some white dwarfs show evidence for rocky material floating in their atmospheres5, in warm debris disks6-9 or orbiting very closely10-12, which has been interpreted as the debris of rocky planets that were scattered inwards and tidally disrupted13. Recently, the discovery of a gaseous debris disk with a composition similar to that of ice giant planets14 demonstrated that massive planets might also find their way into tight orbits around white dwarfs, but it is unclear whether these planets can survive the journey. So far, no intact planets have been detected in close orbits around white dwarfs. Here we report the observation of a giant planet candidate transiting the white dwarf WD 1856+534 (TIC 267574918) every 1.4 days. We observed and modelled the periodic dimming of the white dwarf caused by the planet candidate passing in front of the star in its orbit. The planet candidate is roughly the same size as Jupiter and is no more than 14 times as massive (with 95 per cent confidence). Other cases of white dwarfs with close brown dwarf or stellar companions are explained as the consequence of common-envelope evolution, wherein the original orbit is enveloped during the red giant phase and shrinks owing to friction. In this case, however, the long orbital period (compared with other white dwarfs with close brown dwarf or stellar companions) and low mass of the planet candidate make common-envelope evolution less likely. Instead, our findings for the WD 1856+534 system indicate that giant planets can be scattered into tight orbits without being tidally disrupted, motivating the search for smaller transiting planets around white dwarfs.},

Despite poor observing conditions, we detect three of the planets (HR 8799 bcd), two of them (HR 8799 bc) without advanced image processing. Comparing these data with previously published 1998-2011 astrometry and that from re-reduced 2010 October Keck data constrains the orbits of the planets. Analyzing the planets' astrometry separately, HR 8799 d's orbit is likely inclined at least 25° from face-on and the others may be on inclined orbits. For semimajor axis ratios consistent with a 4:2:1 mean-motion resonance, our analysis yields precise values for HR 8799 bcd's orbital parameters and strictly constrains the planets' eccentricities to be less than 0.18-0.3. However, we find no acceptable orbital solutions with this resonance that place the planets in face-on orbits; HR 8799 d shows the largest deviation from such orbits. Moreover, few orbits make HR 8799 d coplanar with b and c, whereas dynamical stability analyses used to constrain the planets' masses typically assume coplanar and/or face-on orbits. This Letter illustrates the significant science gain enabled with the release of the NIRC2 archive.},

Subsequent detection of the planets in the Hα line indicates that they are still accreting material through circumplanetary disks. In this Letter, we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the dust continuum emission at 855 μm at high angular resolution ({\textasciitilde}20 mas, 2.3 au) that aim to resolve the circumplanetary disks and constrain their dust masses. Our observations confirm the presence of a compact source of emission co-located with PDS 70 c, spatially separated from the circumstellar disk and less extended than {\textasciitilde}1.2 au in radius, a value close to the expected truncation radius of the circumplanetary disk at a third of the Hill radius. The emission around PDS 70 c has a peak intensity of {\textasciitilde}86 ± 16 μJy beam-1, which corresponds to a dust mass of {\textasciitilde}0.031 M⊕ or {\textasciitilde}0.007 M⊕, assuming that it is only constituted of 1 μm or 1 mm sized grains, respectively. We also detect extended, low surface brightness continuum emission within the cavity near PDS 70 b. We observe an optically thin inner disk within 18 au of the star with an emission that could result from small micron-sized grains transported from the outer disk through the orbits of b and c. In addition, we find that the outer disk resolves into a narrow and bright ring with a faint inner shoulder.},

	abstract = {The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has found multiple dust gaps and rings in a number of protoplanetary disks in continuum emission at millimeter wavelengths. The origin of such structures is under debate. Recently, we documented how one super-Earth planet can open multiple (up to five) dust gaps in a disk with low viscosity (α ≲ 10-4). In this paper, we examine how the positions, depths, and total number of gaps opened by one planet depend on input parameters, and apply our results to real systems. Gap locations (equivalently, spacings) are the easiest metric to use when making comparisons between theory and observations, as positions can be robustly measured. We fit the locations of gaps empirically as functions of planet mass and disk aspect ratio. We find that the locations of the double gaps in HL Tau and TW Hya, and of all three gaps in HD 163296, are consistent with being opened by a sub-Saturn mass planet. This scenario predicts the locations of other gaps in HL Tau and TW Hya, some of which appear consistent with current observations. We also show how the Rossby wave instability may develop at the edges of several gaps and result in multiple dusty vortices, all caused by one planet. A planet as low in mass as Mars may produce multiple dust gaps in the terrestrial planet-forming region.},

With spatially and spectrally resolved molecular emission line measurements provided by (sub)millimeter interferometric observations, it is possible to directly measure non-thermal motions in the disk gas that can be attributed to this turbulence. We report a new constraint on the turbulence in the disk around HD 163296, a nearby young A star, determined from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Science Verification observations of four CO emission lines (the CO(3-2), CO(2-1), 13CO(2-1), and C18O(2-1) transitions). The different optical depths for these lines permit probes of non-thermal line-widths at a range of physical conditions (temperature and density) and depths into the disk interior. We derive stringent limits on the non-thermal motions in the upper layers of the outer disk such that any contribution to the line-widths from turbulence is {\textless}3\% of the local sound speed. These limits are approximately an order of magnitude lower than theoretical predictions for full-blown magnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability, potentially suggesting that this mechanism is less efficient in the outer (R ≳ 30 AU) disk than has been previously considered.},

All of our targets are located in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud (d {\textasciitilde} 125 pc) and have spectral energy distributions (SEDs) suggesting the presence of inner opacity holes. We use these ground-based data to estimate the disk mass, multiplicity, and accretion rate for each object in our sample in order to investigate the mechanisms potentially responsible for their inner holes. We find that transition disks are a heterogeneous group of objects, with disk masses ranging from {\textless}0.6 to 40 M JUP and accretion rates ranging from {\textless}10-11 to 10-7 M sun yr-1, but most tend to have much lower masses and accretion rates than "full disks" (i.e., disks without opacity holes). Eight of our targets have stellar companions: six of them are binaries and the other two are triple systems. In four cases, the stellar companions are close enough to suspect they are responsible for the inferred inner holes. We find that nine of our 26 targets have low disk mass ({\textless}2.5 M JUP) and negligible accretion ({\textless}10-11 M sun yr-1), and are thus consistent with photoevaporating (or photoevaporated) disks. Four of these nine non-accreting objects have fractional disk luminosities {\textless}10-3 and could already be in a debris disk stage. Seventeen of our transition disks are accreting. Thirteen of these accreting objects are consistent with grain growth. The remaining four accreting objects have SEDs suggesting the presence of sharp inner holes, and thus are excellent candidates for harboring giant planets.

To put these results in a more general context, we collected publicly available data to construct the optical to millimeter wavelength SEDs of over 120 additional PMS stars. We find that the near-IR and mid-IR emissions remain optically thick in objects whose disk masses span 2 orders of magnitude ({\textasciitilde}0.5-50 MJup). Taken together, these results imply that, in general, inner disks start to dissipate only after the outer disk has been significantly depleted of mass.

	abstract = {We present a high spatial resolution submillimeter continuum survey of 24 circumstellar disks in the Taurus-Auriga and Ophiuchus-Scorpius star formation regions using the SMA. In the context of a simple model, we use broadband spectral energy distributions and submillimeter visibilities to derive constraints on some basic parameters that describe the structure of these disks. For the typical disk in the sample we infer a radial surface density distribution Σr{\textasciitilde}r-p with a median p{\textasciitilde}0.5, although consideration of the systematic effects of some of our assumptions suggest that steeper distributions with p{\textasciitilde}1 are more reasonable. The distribution of the outer radii of these disks shows a distinct peak at Rd{\textasciitilde}200 AU, with only a few cases where the disk emission is completely unresolved. Based on these disk structure measurements, the mass accretion rates, and the typical spectral and spatial distributions of submillimeter emission, we show that the observations are in good agreement with similarity solutions for steady accretion disks that have a viscosity parameter α{\textasciitilde}0.01. We provide new estimates of the spectral dependence of the disk opacity κν{\textasciitilde}νβ with a mean β{\textasciitilde}1.0, corrected for optically thick emission. This typical value of β is consistent with model predictions for the collisional growth of solids to millimeter-size scales in the outer disk. Although direct constraints on planet formation in these disks are not currently available, the extrapolated density distributions inferred here are substantially shallower than those calculated based on the solar system or extrasolar planets and typically used in planet formation models. It is possible that we are substantially underestimating disk densities due to an incomplete submillimeter opacity prescription.},

The submillimeter detection rate is 61\% to a completeness limit of {\textasciitilde}10 mJy (3 σ) at 850 μm. The inferred circumstellar disk masses are lognormally distributed with a mean mass of {\textasciitilde}5×10-3 Msolar and a large dispersion (0.5 dex). Roughly one-third of the submillimeter sources have disk masses larger than the minimal nebula from which the solar system formed. The median disk-to-star mass ratio is 0.5\%. The empirical behavior of the submillimeter continuum is best described as Fν{\textasciitilde}ν2.0+/-0.5 between 350 μm and 1.3 mm, which we argue is due to the combined effects of the fraction of optically thick emission and a flatter frequency behavior of the opacity compared to the interstellar medium. The latter effect could be due to a substantial population of large dust grains, which presumably would have grown through collisional agglomeration. In this sample, the only stellar property that is correlated with the outer disk is the presence of a companion. We find evidence for significant decreases in submillimeter flux densities, disk masses, and submillimeter continuum slopes along the canonical infrared spectral energy distribution evolution sequence for young stellar objects. The fraction of objects detected in the submillimeter is essentially identical to the fraction with excess near-infrared emission, suggesting that dust in the inner and outer disks is removed nearly simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Context. The effects of a planet sculpting the disk from which it formed are most likely to be found in disks that are in transition between being classical protoplanetary and debris disks. Recent direct imaging of transition disks has revealed structures such as dust rings, gaps, and spiral arms, but an unambiguous link between these structures and sculpting planets is yet to be found. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to find signs of ongoing planet-disk interaction and study the distribution of small grains at the surface of the transition disk around RX J1615.3-3255 (RX J1615). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We observed RX J1615 with VLT/SPHERE. From these observations, we obtained polarimetric imaging with ZIMPOL (R'-band) and IRDIS (J), and IRDIS (H2H3) dual-band imaging with simultaneous spatially resolved spectra with the IFS (YJ). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We image the disk for the first time in scattered light and detect two arcs, two rings, a gap and an inner disk with marginal evidence for an inner cavity. The shapes of the arcs suggest that they are probably segments of full rings. Ellipse fitting for the two rings and inner disk yield a disk inclination I = 47 ± 2° and find semi-major axes of 1.50 ± 0.01'' (278 au), 1.06 ± 0.01'' (196 au) and 0.30 ± 0.01'' (56 au), respectively. We determine the scattering surface height above the midplane, based on the projected ring center offsets. Nine point sources are detected between 2.1'' and 8.0'' separation and considered as companion candidates. With NACO data we recover four of the nine point sources, which we determine to be not co-moving, and therefore unbound to the system. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We present the first detection of the transition disk of RX J1615 in scattered light. The height of the rings indicate limited flaring of the disk surface, which enables partial self-shadowing in the disk. The outermost arc either traces the bottom of the disk or it is another ring with semi-major axis ≳ 2.35'' (435 au). We explore both scenarios, extrapolating the complete shape of the feature, which will allow us to distinguish between the two in future observations. The most attractive scenario, where the arc traces the bottom of the outer ring, requires the disk to be truncated at r ≈ 360 au. If the closest companion candidate is indeed orbiting the disk at 540 au, then it would be the most likely cause for such truncation. This companion candidate, as well as the remaining four, all require follow up observations to determine if they are bound to the system. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under programme IDs 095.C-0298(A), 095.C-0298(B), and 095.C-0693(A) during guaranteed and open time observations of the SPHERE consortium, and on NACO observations: program IDs: 085.C-0012(A), 087.C-0111(A), and 089.C-0133(A).

The protoplanetary disk around the F-type star HD 135344B (SAO 206462) is in a transition stage and shows many intriguing structures both in scattered light and thermal (sub-)millimeter emission which are possibly related to planet formation processes. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to study the morphology and surface brightness of the disk in scattered light to gain insight into the innermost disk regions, the formation of protoplanets, planet-disk interactions traced in the surface and midplane layers, and the dust grain properties of the disk surface. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We have carried out high-contrast polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) observations with VLT/SPHERE and obtained polarized scattered light images with ZIMPOL in the R and I-bands and with IRDIS in the Y and J-bands. The scattered light images and surface brightness profiles are used to study in detail structures in the disk surface and brightness variations. We have constructed a 3D radiative transfer model to support the interpretation of several detected shadow features. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The scattered light images reveal with unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity the spiral arms as well as the 25 au cavity of the disk. Multiple shadow features are discovered on the outer disk with one shadow only being present during the second observation epoch. A positive surface brightness gradient is observed in the stellar irradiation corrected (r{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}-scaled) images in southwest direction possibly due to an azimuthally asymmetric perturbation of the temperature and/or surface density by the passing spiral arms. The disk integrated polarized flux, normalized to the stellar flux, shows a positive trend towards longer wavelengths which we attribute to large (2πa ≳ λ) aggregate dust grains in the disk surface. Part of the non-azimuthal polarization signal in the U{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}φ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} image of the J-band observation can be attributed to multiple scattering in the disk. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The detected shadow features and their possible variability have the potential to provide insight into the structure of and processes occurring in the innermost disk regions. Possible explanations for the presence of the shadows include a 22° misaligned inner disk, a warped disk region that connects the inner disk with the outer disk, and variable or transient phenomena such as a perturbation of the inner disk or an asymmetric accretion flow. The spiral arms are best explained by one or multiple protoplanets in the exterior of the disk although no gap is detected beyond the spiral arms up to 1.''0. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, ESO No. 095.C-0273(A) and 095.C-0273(D).},

	abstract = {Context. V1247 Orionis harbours a pre-transitional disc with a partially cleared gap. Earlier interferometric and polarimetric observations revealed strong asymmetries both in the gap region and in the outer disc. The presence of a companion was inferred to explain these asymmetric structures and the ongoing disc clearing. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Using an extensive set of multi-wavelength and multi-epoch observations we aimed to identify the origin of the previously detected asymmetries. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We have observed V1247 Ori at three epochs spanning 678 days using sparse aperture masking interferometry with Keck/NIRC2 and VLT/NACO. In addition, we search for signs of accretion through VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL spectral differential imaging in Hα and R-band continuum. Our SMA sub-millimetre interferometry in 880 μm continuum and in the CO(3-2) line allows us to constrain the orientation and direction of rotation of the outer disc. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find the L'-band emission to be dominated by static features which trace forward-scattered dust emission from the inner edge of the outer disc located to the north-east. In H- and K-bands, we see evidence for a companion candidate that moved systematically by 45° within the first 345 days. The separation of the companion candidate is not well constrained, but the observed position angle change is consistent with Keplerian motion of a body located on a 6 au orbit. From the SMA CO moment map, the location of the disc rim, and the detected orbital motion, we deduced the three-dimensional orientation of the disc. We see no indication of accretion in Hα and set upper limits for an accreting companion. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The measured contrast of the companion candidate in H and K is consistent with an actively accreting protoplanet.

	abstract = {Context. Debris disks or belts are important signposts for the presence of colliding planetesimals and, therefore, for ongoing planet formation and evolution processes in young planetary systems. Imaging of debris material at small separations from the star is very challenging but provides valuable insights into the spatial distribution of the so-called hot dust produced by solid bodies located in or near the habitable zone. We report the first detection of scattered light from the hot dust around the nearby (d = 28.33 pc) A star HD 172555. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We want to constrain the geometric structure of the detected debris disk using polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) with a spatial resolution of 25 mas and an inner working angle of about 0.1″. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We measured the polarized light of HD 172555, with SPHERE/ZIMPOL, in the very broadband (VBB) or RI filter (λ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 735 nm, Δλ = 290 nm) for the projected separations between 0.08″ (2.3 au) and 0.77″ (22 au). We constrained the disk parameters by fitting models for scattering of an optically thin dust disk taking the limited spatial resolution and coronagraphic attenuation of our data into account. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The geometric structure of the disk in polarized light shows roughly the same orientation and outer extent as obtained from thermal emission at 18 μm. Our image indicates the presence of a strongly inclined (i ≈ 103.5°), roughly axisymmetric dust belt with an outer radius in the range between 0.3″ (8.5 au) and 0.4″ (11.3 au). An inner disk edge is not detected in the data.

The comparison with previous estimates suggests that the disk inclination could increase with the stellocentric distance, although the different measurements are still consistent within the error bars.

If this scenario is confirmed, it could explain the presence of atomic gas in the inner disk that would otherwise accrete on to the central star on a timescale of a few months/years, as previously indicated from spectro-interferometric data, and could be related with additional (undetected) planets.},

	abstract = {Context. MWC 758 is a young star surrounded by a transitional disk. The disk shows an inner cavity and spiral arms that could be caused by the presence of protoplanets. Recently, a protoplanet candidate has been detected around MWC 758 through high-resolution L'-band observations. The candidate is located inside the disk cavity at a separation of 111 mas from the central star, and at an average position angle of 165.5°. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim at detecting accreting protoplanet candidates within the disk of MWC 758 through angular spectral differential imaging (ASDI) observations in the optical regime. In particular, we explore the emission at the position of the detected planet candidate. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We have performed simultaneous adaptive optics observations in the H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}α{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} line and the adjacent continuum using SPHERE/ZIMPOL at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The data analysis does not reveal any H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}α{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} signal around the target. The derived contrast curve in the B\_Ha filter allows us to derive a 5σ upper limit of 7.6 mag at 111 mas, the separation of the previously detected planet candidate. This contrast translates into a H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}α{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} line luminosity of L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}α{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≲ 5×10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} at 111 mas. Assuming that L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}α{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} scales with L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}acc{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} as in classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) as a first approximation, we can estimate an accretion luminosity of L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}acc{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 3.7 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} for the protoplanet candidate. For the predicted mass range of MWC 758b, 0.5-5 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, this implies accretion rates smaller than Ṁ \&lt; 3.4 × (10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-8{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}-10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-9{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater})M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, for an average planet radius of 1.1 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Therefore, our estimates are consistent with the predictions of accreting circumplanetary accretion models for R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 1R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The ZIMPOL line luminosity is consistent with the H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}α{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} upper limit predicted by these models for truncation radii ≲3.2 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The non-detection of any H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}α{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} emitting source in the ZIMPOL images does not allow us to unveil the nature of the L' detected source.

	abstract = {Context. The mechanisms of planet formation are still under debate. We know little about how planets form, even if more than 4000 exoplanets have been detected to date. Recent investigations target the cot of newly born planets: the protoplanetary disk. At the first stages of their life, exoplanets still accrete material from the gas-rich disk in which they are embedded. Transitional disks are indeed disks that show peculiarities, such as gaps, spiral arms, and rings, which can be connected to the presence of substellar companions. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: To investigate what is responsible for these features, we selected all the known transitional disks in the solar neighborhood (\&lt;200 pc) that are visible from the southern hemisphere. We conducted a survey of 11 transitional disks with the SPHERE instrument at the Very Large Telescope. This is the largest Hα survey that has been conducted so far to look for protoplanets. The observations were performed with the Hα filter of ZIMPOL in order to target protoplanets that are still in the accretion stage. All the selected targets are very young stars, less than 20 Myr, and show low extinction in the visible. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We reduced the ZIMPOL pupil stabilized data by applying the method of the angular spectral differential imaging (ASDI), which combines both techniques. The datacubes are composed of the Cnt\_Hα and the narrow band filter Hα, which are taken simultaneously to permit the suppression of the speckle pattern. The principal component analysis method was employed for the reduction of the data. For each dataset, we derived the 5σ contrast limit and converted it in upper limits on the accretion luminosity. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We do not detect any new accreting substellar companions around the targeted transition disks down to an average contrast of 12 magnitudes at 0.''2 from the central star. We have recovered the signal of the accreting M star companion around the star HD 142527. We have detected and resolved, for the first time in visible light, the quadruple system HD 98800. For every other system, we can exclude the presence of massive actively accreting companions, assuming that the accretion is not episodic and that the extinction is negligible.

We obtained two data sets in 2015 May and 2016 March. Our data allow us to explore dust scattering around the star down to a radius of ∼0.″025 (∼4 au). The well-known outer disk is clearly detected at higher resolution than before and shows previously unknown substructures, including spirals going inward into the cavity. Close to the star, dust scattering is detected at high signal-to-noise ratio, but it is unclear whether the signal represents the inner disk, which has been linked to the two prominent local minima in the scattering of the outer disk that are interpreted as shadows. An interpretation of an inclined inner disk combined with a dust halo is compatible with both our and previous observations, but other arrangements of the dust cannot be ruled out. Dust scattering is also present within the large gap between ∼30 and ∼140 au. The comparison of the two data sets suggests rapid evolution of the inner regions of the disk, potentially driven by the interaction with the close-in M-dwarf companion, around which no polarimetric signal is detected.},

Using state-of-the-art simulations of JWST performance, in combination with the latest evolutionary models, we present the most sophisticated simulated mass sensitivity limits of JWST coronagraphy to date. In particular, we focus our efforts towards observations of members within the nearby young moving groups β Pictoris and TW Hya. These limits indicate that whilst JWST will provide little improvement towards imaging exoplanets at short separations, at wide separations the increase in sensitivity is dramatic. We predict JWST will be capable of imaging sub-Jupiter mass objects beyond ∼30 au, sub-Saturn mass objects beyond ∼50 au, and that beyond ∼100 au, JWST will be capable of directly imaging companions as small as 0.1 MJ - at least an order of magnitude improvement over the leading ground-based instruments. Probing this unexplored parameter space will be of immediate value to modelling efforts focused on planetary formation and population synthesis. JWST will also serve as an excellent complement to ground-based observatories through its unique ability to characterize previously detected companions across the near- to mid-infrared for the first time.},

Because of the well-measured radius and luminosity of Sirius A, we employed the TYCHO stellar evolution code to determine the age of the Sirius AB binary system accurately, at 225-250 Myr. Note that this fit requires the assumption of solar abundance and the use of the new Asplund et al. primordial solar metallicity. No fit to Sirius A's position is possible using the old Grevesse \& Sauval scale. Because the Sirius B white dwarf parameters have also been determined accurately from space observations, the cooling age could be determined from recent calculations by Fontaine et al. or Wood to be 124+/-10 Myr. The difference in the two ages yields the nuclear lifetime and mass of the original primary star, 5.056+0.374-0.276 Msolar. This result yields, in principle, the most accurate data point at relatively high masses for the initial-to-final mass relation. However, the analysis relies on the assumption that the primordial abundance of the Sirius stars was solar, based on membership in the Sirius supercluster. A recent study suggests that its membership in the group is by no means certain.},

The direct detection of such companions would allow the spectroscopic investigation of objects with temperatures much lower ({\textless}500 K) than the coolest brown dwarfs currently observed. These ultra-low-mass substellar objects would have spectral types {\textgreater}T8.5, and so could belong to the proposed Y dwarf spectral sequence. The detection of a planet around a white dwarf would prove that such objects can survive the final stages of stellar evolution and place constraints on the frequency of planetary systems around their progenitors (with masses between 1.5 and 8Msolar, i.e. early B to mid-F). This paper presents the results of a multi epoch J band common proper motion survey of 23 nearby equatorial and Northern hemisphere white dwarfs. We rule out the presence of any common proper motion companions, with limiting masses determined from the completeness limit of each observation, to 18 white dwarfs. For the remaining five targets, the motion of the white dwarf is not sufficiently separated from the non-moving background objects in each field. These targets require additional observations to conclusively rule out the presence of any common proper motion companions. From our completeness limits, we tentatively suggest that {\textless}{\textasciitilde}5 per cent of white dwarfs have substellar companions with Teff {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 500 K between projected physical separations of 60-200 au.},

In this Letter, we study the evolution of a two-body system wherein the orbit adjusts due to structural changes in the primary, dissipation of orbital energy via tides, and mass-loss during the giant phases; previous studies have not incorporated changes in the primary's spin. For companions ranging from Jupiter's mass to ∼0.3 M☉ and primaries ranging from 1 to 3 M☉, we determine the minimum initial semimajor axis required for the companion to avoid engulfment by the primary during post-main-sequence evolution, and highlight the implications for the ultimate survival of the known exoplanets. We present regions in secondary mass and orbital period space where an engulfed companion might be expected to survive the common envelope phase (CEP), and compare with known M dwarf+WD short-period binaries. Finally, we note that engulfed Earth-like planets cannot survive a CEP. Detection of a first-generation terrestrial planet in the WD habitable zone requires scattering from a several au orbit to a high-eccentricity orbit (with a periastron of ∼R☉) from which it is damped into a circular orbit via tidal friction, possibly rendering it an uninhabitable, charred ember.},

Dust particles with high sublimation temperature form a significant dust ring, which could be found in the vicinity of the sun through in-situ spacecraft measurements. While the existence of such a ring in a debris disk could not be identified in the spectral energy distribution (SED), the size of a dust-free zone shapes the SED.

The selection criteria to define the whole sample were tuned to cover the broad-band characteristics of known binary post-AGB stars. The whole sample includes 20 dusty RV Tauri stars from the General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS). We supplemented our own Geneva optical photometry with literature data to cover a broad range of fluxes from the UV to the far-IR.Results.All the SEDs display very similar characteristics: a large IR excess with a dust excess starting near the sublimation temperature, irrespective of the effective temperature of the central star. Moreover, when available, the long wavelength fluxes show a black-body slope indicative of the presence of a component of large mm sized grains.Conclusions.We argue that in all systems, gravitationally bound dusty discs are present. The discs must be puffed-up to cover a large opening angle for the central star and we argue that the discs have some similarity with the passive discs detected around young stellar objects. We interpret the presence of a disc to be a signature for binarity of the central object, but this will need confirmation by long-term monitoring of the radial velocities. We argue that dusty RV Tauri stars are those binaries which happen to be in the Population II instability strip.},

	abstract = {As spiral waves driven by a planet in a gaseous disk steepen into a shock, they deposit angular momentum, opening a gap in the disk. This has been well studied using both linear theory and numerical simulations, but so far only for the primary spiral arm: the one directly attached to the planet. Using 2D hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the secondary and tertiary arms driven by a planet can also open gaps as they steepen into shocks. The depths of the secondary/tertiary gaps in surface density grow with time in a low-viscosity disk (α =5× \{10\}-5), so even low-mass planets (e.g., super-Earth or mini-Neptune-mass) embedded in the disk can open multiple observable gaps, provided that sufficient time has passed. Applying our results to the HL Tau disk, we show that a single 30 Earth-mass planet embedded in the ring at 68.8 au (B5) can reasonably well reproduce the positions of the two major gaps at 13.2 and 32.3 au (D1 and D2), and roughly reproduce two other major gaps at 64.2 and 74.7 au (D5 and D6) seen in the mm continuum. The positions of secondary/tertiary gaps are found to be sensitive to the planetary mass and the disk temperature profile, so with accurate observational measurements of the temperature structure, the positions of multiple gaps can be used to constrain the mass of the planet. We also comment on the gaps seen in the TW Hya and HD 163296 disk.},

We argue that the entropy of accreted material is determined by boundary layer processes, unlike the “cold-” or “hot-start” hypotheses usually invoked in the core-accretion and direct-collapse scenarios. A simple planetary evolution model illustrates how a wide range of radius and luminosity tracks become possible, depending on details of the accretion process. Specifically, the protoplanet evolves toward “hot-start” tracks if the scale height of the boundary layer is ≳0.24, a value not much larger than the scale height of the circumplanetary disk. Understanding the luminosity and radii of young giant planets will thus require detailed models of circumplanetary accretion.},

	abstract = {Transition discs are protoplanetary discs that show evidence for large holes or wide gaps (with widths comparable to their radii) in their dust component. These discs could be giving us clues about the disc destruction mechanism or hints about the location and time-scales for the formation of planets. However, at the moment there remain key gaps in our theoretical understanding. The vast majority of transition discs are accreting onto their central stars, indicating that-at least close to the star-dust has been depleted from the gas by a very large amount. In this review, we discuss evidence for two distinct populations of transition discs: mm-faint-those with low mm-fluxes, small holes (≲ 10 AU), and low accretion rates ({\textasciitilde} 10-10 - 10-9 M⊙ yr-1) and mm-bright-discs with large mm-fluxes, large holes (≳ 20 AU), and high accretion rates {\textasciitilde} 10-8 M⊙ yr-1. MM-faint transition discs are consistent with what would naively be expected from a disc undergoing dispersal; however, mm-bright discs are not, and are likely to be rare and long-lived objects. We discuss the two commonly proposed mechanisms for creating transition discs: photoevaporation and planet-disc interactions, with a particular emphasis on how they would evolve in these models, comparing these predictions to the observed population. More theoretical work on explaining the lack of optically thick, non-accreting transition discs is required in both the photoevaporation and planetary hypothesis, before we can start to use transition discs to constrain models of planet formation. Finally, we suggest that the few discs with primordial looking spectral energy distribution, but serendipitously imaged showing large cavities in the mm (e.g. MWC758 and WSB 60) may represent a hidden population of associated objects. Characterising and understanding how these objects fit into the overall paradigm may allow us to unravel the mystery of transition discs.},

	abstract = {Transitional disks are objects whose inner disk regions have undergone substantial clearing. The Spitzer Space Telescope produced detailed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of transitional disks that allowed us to infer their radial dust disk structure in some detail, revealing the diversity of this class of disks. The growing sample of transitional disks also opened up the possibility of demographic studies, which provided unique insights. There now exist (sub)millimeter and infrared images that confirm the presence of large clearings of dust in transitional disks. In addition, protoplanet candidates have been detected within some of these clearings. Transitional disks are thought to be a strong link to planet formation around young stars and are a key area to study if further progress is to be made on understanding the initial stages of planet formation. Here we provide a review and synthesis of transitional disk observations to date with the aim of providing timely direction to the field, which is about to undergo its next burst of growth as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) reaches its full potential. We discuss what we have learned about transitional disks from SEDs, color-color diagrams, and imaging in the (sub)millimeter and infrared. We note the limitations of these techniques, particularly with respect to the sizes of the clearings currently detectable, and highlight the need for pairing broadband SEDs with multi-wavelength images to paint a more detailed picture of transitional disk structure. We review the gas in transitional disks, keeping in mind that future observations with ALMA will give us unprecedented access to gas in disks, and also observed infrared variability pointing to variable transitional disk structure, which may have implications for disks in general. We then distill the observations into constraints for the main disk-clearing mechanisms proposed to date (i.e., photoevaporation, grain growth, and companions) and explore how the expected observational signatures from these mechanisms, particularly planet-induced disk clearing, compare to actual observations. Finally, we discuss future avenues of inquiry to be pursued with ALMA, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and the next generation of groundbased telescopes.},

These disks generally persist for several million years, during which time some material accretes onto the star, some is lost through outflows and photoevaporation, and some condenses into centimeter- and larger-sized bodies or planetesimals. Through observations mainly at IR through millimeter wavelengths, we can determine how common disks are at different ages; measure basic properties including mass, size, structure, and composition; and follow their varied evolutionary pathways. In this way, we see the first steps toward exoplanet formation and learn about the origins of the Solar System.

A number of post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are found to host optically thick, dust- and gas-rich circumstellar discs in Keplerian orbits. These discs exhibit evidence of dust evolution, similar to protoplanetary discs; however, since post-AGB discs have substantially shorter lifetimes than protoplanetary discs, they may provide new insights on the grain-growth process. We examine a sample of post-AGB stars with discs to determine the far-infrared and sub-millimetre spectral index by homogeneously fitting a sample of data from Herschel, the Submillimeter Array (SMA), and the literature. We find that grain growth to at least hundreds of micrometres is ubiquitous in these systems, and that the distribution of spectral indices is more similar to that of protoplanetary discs than debris discs. No correlation is found with the mid-infrared colours of the discs, implying that grain growth occurs independently of the disc structure in post-AGB discs. We infer that grain growth to ˜millimetre sizes must occur on time-scales {\textless}{\textless}105 yr, perhaps by orders of magnitude, as the lifetimes of these discs are expected to be ≲105 yr and all objects have converged to the same state. This growth time-scale is short compared to the results of models for protoplanetary discs including fragmentation and may provide new constraints on the physics of grain growth.},

The presence of a disk is usually inferred from the system’s spectral energy distribution and confirmed, for a sub-sample, by interferometric observations. We used the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope to obtain extreme adaptive optics assisted scattered light images of the post-AGB binary system AR Puppis. Data have been obtained in the V, I, and H bands. Our observations have produced the first resolved images of AR Puppis’s circumbinary disk and confirm its edge-on orientation. In our high-angular-resolution and high-dynamic-range images we identify several structural components such as a dark mid-plane, the disk surface, and arc-like features. We discuss the nature of these components and use complementary photometric monitoring to relate them to the orbital phase of the binary system. Because the star is completely obscured by the disk at visible wavelengths, we conclude that the long-term photometric variability of the system must be caused by variable scattering, not extinction, of starlight by the disk over the binary orbit. Finally, we discuss how the short disk lifetimes and fast evolution of the host stars compared to the ages at which protoplanetary disks are typically observed make systems like AR Puppis valuable extreme laboratories to study circumstellar disk evolution and constrain the timescale of dust grain growth during the planet formation process.

The disk formation, current structure, and further evolution are, however, poorly understood. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to constrain the structure of the circumstellar material around the post-AGB binary and RV Tauri pulsator AC Her. We want to constrain the spatial distribution of the amorphous and of the crystalline dust. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We present very high-quality mid-IR interferometric data that were obtained with the MIDI/VLTI instrument. We analyze the MIDI visibilities and differential phases in combination with the full spectral energy distribution, using the MCMax radiative transfer code, to find a good structure model of AC Her's circumbinary disk. We include a grain size distribution and midplane settling of dust self-consistently in our models. The spatial distribution of crystalline forsterite in the disk is investigated with the mid-IR features, the 69 μm band and the 11.3 μm signatures in the interferometric data. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: All the data are well fitted by our best model. The inclination and position angle of the disk are precisely determined at i = 50 ± 8° and PA = 305 ± 10°. We firmly establish that the inner disk radius is about an order of magnitude larger than the dust sublimation radius. The best-fit dust grain size distribution shows that significant grain growth has occurred, with a significant amount of mm-sized grains now being settled to the midplane of the disk. A large total dust mass ≥10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is needed to fit the mm fluxes. By assuming α{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}turb{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.01, a good fit is obtained with a small grain size power law index of 3.25, combined with a small gas/dust ratio ≤10. The resulting gas mass is compatible with recent estimates employing direct gas diagnostics. The spatial distribution of the forsterite is different from the amorphous dust, as more warm forsterite is needed in the surface layers of the inner disk. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The disk in the AC Her system is in a very evolved state, as shown by its small gas/dust ratio and large inner hole. Mid-IR interferometry offers unique constraints, complementary to mid-IR features, for studying the mineralogy in disks. A better uv coverage is needed to constrain in detail the distribution of the crystalline forsterite in the disk of AC Her, but we find strong similarities with the protoplanetary disk HD 100546. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under program ID 075.D-0605.},

	abstract = {Context. The presence of stable disks around post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binaries is a widespread phenomenon. Also, the presence of (molecular) outflows is now commonly inferred in these systems. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: In the first paper of this series, a surprisingly large fraction of optical light was found to be resolved in the 89 Her post-AGB binary system. The data showed that this flux arises from close to the central binary. Scattering off the inner rim of the circumbinary disk, or scattering in a dusty outflow were suggested as two possible origins. With detailed dust radiative transfer models of the circumbinary disk, we aim to discriminate between the two proposed configurations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: By including Herschel/SPIRE photometry, we extend the spectral energy distribution (SED) such that it now fully covers UV to sub-mm wavelengths. The MCMax Monte Carlo radiative transfer code is used to create a large grid of disk models. Our models include a self-consistent treatment of dust settling as well as of scattering. A Si-rich composition with two additional opacity sources, metallic Fe or amorphous C, are tested. The SED is fit together with archival mid-IR (MIDI) visibilities, and the optical and near-IR visibilities of Paper I. In this way we constrain the structure of the disk, with a focus on its inner rim. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The near-IR visibility data require a smooth inner rim, here obtained with a double power-law parameterization of the radial surface density distribution. A model can be found that fits all of the IR photometric and interferometric data well, with either of the two continuum opacity sources. Our best-fit passive models are characterized by a significant amount of {\textasciitilde}mm-sized grains, which are settled to the midplane of the disk. Not a single disk model fits our data at optical wavelengths because of the opposing constraints imposed by the optical and near-IR interferometric data. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: A geometry in which a passive, dusty, and puffed-up circumbinary disk is present, can reproduce all of the IR, but not the optical observations of 89 Her.

Using the observed infrared spectra we determine the mineralogy and dust parameters of the discs, and look for possible differences between the Galactic and extragalactic sources. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Modelling the full spectral range observed allows us to determine the dust species present in the disc and different physical parameters such as grain sizes, dust abundance ratios, and the dust and continuum temperatures. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find that all the discs are dominated by emission features of crystalline and amorphous silicate dust. Only a few sample sources show features due to CO{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} gas or carbonaceous molecules such as PAHs and C{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}60{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} fullerenes. Our analysis shows that dust grain processing in these discs is strong, resulting in large average grain sizes and a very high crystallinity fraction. However, we do not find any correlations between the derived dust parameters and properties of the central source. There also does not seem to be a noticeable difference between the mineralogy of the Galactic and LMC sources. Even though the observed spectra are very similar to those of protoplanetary discs around young stars, showing similar mineralogy and strong grain processing, we do find evidence for differences in the physical and chemical processes of the dust processing. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations obtained at the European Southern Observatory (ESO), La Silla, observing program 072.D-0263 and 077.D-0555, and on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope (program id 3274 and 50092), which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA.Appendix A is available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Context. The circumstellar environment of evolved stars is generally rich in molecular gas and dust. Typically, the entire environment is either oxygen-rich or carbon-rich, depending on the evolution of the central star. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: In this paper we discuss three evolved disc sources with evidence of atypical emission lines in their infrared spectra. The stars were taken from a larger sample of post-AGB binaries for which we have Spitzer infrared spectra, characterised by the presence of a stable oxygen-rich circumbinary disc. Our previous studies have shown that the infrared spectra of post-AGB disc sources are dominated by silicate dust emission, often with an extremely high crystallinity fraction. However, the three sources described here are selected because they show a peculiar molecular chemistry. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Using Spitzer infrared spectroscopy, we study in detail the peculiar mineralogy of the three sample stars. Using the observed emission features, we identify the different observed dust, molecular and gas species. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The infrared spectra show emission features due to various oxygen-rich dust components, as well as CO{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} gas. All three sources show the strong infrared bands generally ascribed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, two sample sources show C{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}60{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} fullerene bands. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Even though the majority of post-AGB disc sources are dominated by silicate dust in their circumstellar environment, we do find evidence that, for some sources at least, additional processing must occur to explain the presence of large carbonaceous molecules. There is evidence that some of these sources are still oxygen-rich, which makes the detection of these molecules even more surprising. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}This research has made use of the SIMBAD database, operated at CDS, Strasbourg, France.

The broad-band SEDs show a large IR excess with a black-body slope at long wavelengths in six of the seven stars, R Sct being the noticeable exception. This long wavelength slope is best explained assuming the presence of a dust component of large grains in the circumstellar material. We show that the most likely distribution of the circumstellar dust around the six systems is that the dust resides in a disc. Moreover, very small outflow velocities are needed to explain the presence of dust near the sublimation temperature and we speculate that the discs are Keplerian. The structure and evolution of these compact discs are as yet not understood but a likely prerequisite for their formation is that the dusty RV Tauri stars are binaries.},

We describe the equations of state of planetary materials and the construction of static structural models and thermal evolution models. We apply these models to transiting planets close to their parent stars, as well as directly imaged planets far from their parent stars. Mechanisms that have been postulated to inflate the radii of close-in transiting planets are discussed. We also review knowledge gained from the study of the solar system's giant planets.

It is surrounded by a prominent and complex debris disk that is likely stirred by one or several gas giant exoplanets. The discovery of the RV signature of a giant exoplanet was announced 15 yr ago, but has met with scrutiny due to possible confusion with stellar noise. We confirm the planet with a new compilation and analysis of precise RV data spanning 30 yr, and combine it with upper limits from our direct imaging search, the most sensitive ever performed. The deep images were taken in the Ms band (4.7 μm) with the vortex coronagraph recently installed in W.M. Keck Observatory’s infrared camera NIRC2, which opens a sensitive window for planet searches around nearby adolescent systems. The RV data and direct imaging upper limit maps were combined in an innovative joint Bayesian analysis, providing new constraints on the mass and orbital parameters of the elusive planet. ϵ Eridani b has a mass of MJup and is orbiting ϵ Eridani at about 3.48 ± 0.02 au with a period of 7.37 ± 0.07 yr. The eccentricity of ϵ Eridani b’s orbit is , an order of magnitude smaller than early estimates and consistent with a circular orbit.

Our age estimate for this system corresponds to a companion mass in the range 15–80 MJ, spanning the brown dwarf regime, and so HR 3549 B is another recent addition to the growing list of brown dwarf desert objects with extreme mass ratios.

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010arXiv1001.0581P},
	abstract = {Planets are typically thought to form in protoplanetary disks left over from protostellar disk of their newly formed host star. However, an additional planetary formation route may exist in old evolved binary systems. In such systems stellar evolution could lead to the formation of symbiotic stars, where mass transferred from the expanding evolved star to its binary companion could form an accretion disk around it. Such a disk could provide the necessary environment for the formation of a second generation of planets in both circumstellar or circumbinary configurations. Pre-existing first generation planets surviving the post-MS evolution of such systems may serve as seeds for, and/or interact with, the second generation planets, possibly forming atypical planetary systems. Second generation planetary systems should be typically found in white dwarf binary systems, and may show various observational signatures. Most notably, second generation planets could form in environment which are inaccessible, or less favorable, for first generation planets. The orbital phase space available for the second generation planets could be forbidden (in terms of the system stability) to first generation planets in the pre-evolved progenitor binaries. In addition planets could form in metal poor environments such as globular clusters and/or in double compact object binaries. Observations of planets in such forbidden or unfavorable regions may serve to uniquely identify their second generation character. Finally, we point out a few observed candidate second generation planetary systems, including PSR B1620-26 (in a globular cluster), Gl 86, HD 27442 and all of the currently observed circumbinary planet candidates. A second generation origin for these systems could naturally explain their unique configurations.},

	abstract = {We have completed a direct-imaging search for faint companions (FCs) to 23 stars within 13 pc of the Sun using the Hubble Space Telescope Planetary Camera. The strategy of this search changed considerably from that reported in 1996. To maximize the image contrast between potential FCs and a target star's point-spread function, we adopted the F1042M filter (λc{\textasciitilde}1.02 μm, Δλ{\textasciitilde}0.04 μm) as the primary bandpass of our search. Although our sensitivity to FCs varied with the brightness of and separation from our target stars, an ultimate 10 σ detection limit of m1042{\textasciitilde}18 within 17" of the fainter targets was achieved. As the end of the main sequence occurs at M1042{\textasciitilde}12, this detection limit makes our search for FCs to nearby stars the most sensitive yet published. Despite this great sensitivity, no previously undetected FCs were found. Our survey would have detected all stellar companions within 17" of our target stars, except for any lowest mass companions lying within 0.5"-1" of the brightest (V{\textless}1.5) targets. Applying recent models of brown dwarf spectra and evolution, we find that our search was sensitive to young (0.5 Gyr), low-mass (less than 10 MJ) brown dwarf companions to the fainter targets within 5 pc. A brown dwarf with mass 40 MJ and age 5 Gyr would have been detected at separations greater than 5" from Gl 559A (α Centauri A). Our search was not sensitive to 1 Gyr-old brown dwarfs with masses {\textless}{\textasciitilde}5 MJ, nor was it sensitive to 5 Gyr-old brown dwarfs with masses {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10 MJ. On the positive side, we show the first direct image of the triple system GJ 1245ABC in which all three components are well resolved. Multiband photometry of GJ 1245C suggests for that object a spectral type later than M7. The measured positions of GJ 1245AC are discordant with those expected from published photocentric-orbit elements. The observed positions of four other multiple systems (Gl 65AB, Gl 244AB, Gl 280AB, and Gl 866ABC) also differ from those expected from published orbital elements. The discrepancies noted for Gl 280AB are sufficient to resolve the long-standing inconsistency between Procyon's observed luminosity and that derived from the theoretical mass-luminosity relation. F1042M images of the astrometric binary Gl 105A do not reveal the presence of a fourth component, as has been proposed to reconcile the differences between the observed location of the M7 V companion Gl 105C and the predicted separations of the perturbing body from two independent astrometric studies.},

The spectroscopy shows eight to be DA white dwarfs, with six of these having high signal-to-noise ratio appropriate for our analysis. Two of these white dwarfs are consistent with singly evolved cluster membership, and both are high mass ∼1.07 M⊙, and give equivalent progenitor masses of 4.69 M⊙. To supplement these new high-mass white dwarfs and analyze the initial-final mass relation (IFMR), we also looked at 30 white dwarfs from publicly available data that are mostly all high-mass (≳ 0.9 M⊙). These original published data exhibited significant scatter, and to test if this scatter is true or simply the result of systematics, we have uniformly analyzed the white dwarf spectra and have adopted thorough photometric techniques to derive uniform cluster parameters for their parent clusters. The resulting IFMR scatter is significantly reduced, arguing that mass-loss rates are not stochastic in nature and that within the ranges of metallicity and mass analyzed in this work mass loss is not highly sensitive to variations in metallicity. Lastly, when adopting cluster ages based on Y2 isochrones, the slope of the high-mass IFMR remains steep and consistent with that found from intermediate-mass white dwarfs, giving a linear IFMR from progenitor masses between 3 and 6.5 M⊙. In contrast, when adopting the slightly younger cluster ages based on PARSEC isochrones, the high-mass IFMR has a moderate turnover near an initial mass of 4 M⊙. Based on observations with the W.M.

Another mystery is cited, that of the tribal records of the Sudanese Dogon, which maintains an ancient legend of Sirius A having an invisible companion called Digitaria, composed of a substance called segala, which cannot be lifted by all the humans on earth combined.},

These systems have survived, at least in part, through all stages of stellar evolution that precede the white dwarf. During the time interval ({\textasciitilde}200 million years) that a typical polluted white dwarf in our sample has been cooling it has accreted from its planetary system the mass of one of the largest asteroids in our solar system (e.g., Vesta or Ceres). Usually, this accreted mass will be only a fraction of the total mass of rocky material that orbits these white dwarfs; for plausible planetary system configurations we estimate that this total mass is likely to be at least equal to that of the Sun's asteroid belt, and perhaps much larger.

	abstract = {Standard star photometry dominated the latter half of the twentieth century reaching its zenith in the 1980s. It was introduced to take advantage of the high sensitivity and large dynamic range of photomultiplier tubes compared to photographic plates. As the quantum efficiency of photodetectors improved and the wavelength range extended further to the red, standard systems were modified and refined, and deviations from the original systems proliferated. The revolutionary shift to area detectors for all optical and IR observations forced further changes to standard systems, and the precision and accuracy of much broad- and intermediate-band photometry suffered until more suitable observational techniques and standard reduction procedures were adopted. But the biggest revolution occurred with the production of all-sky photometric surveys. Hipparcos/Tycho was space based, but most, like 2MASS, were ground-based, dedicated survey telescopes. It is very likely that in the future, rather than making a measurement of an object in some standard photometric system, one will simply look up the magnitudes and colors of most objects in catalogs accessed from the Virtual Observatory. In this review the history of standard star photometry will be outlined, and the calibration and realization of standard systems will be examined. Finally, model atmosphere fluxes are now very realistic, and synthetic photometry offers the best prospects for calibrating all photometric systems. Synthetic photometry from observed spectrophotometry should also be used as a matter of course to provide colors within standard systems and to gain insights into the spectra and colors of unusual stars, star clusters and distant galaxies.},

	abstract = {Infrared excesses around white dwarf stars indicate the presence of various astrophysical objects of interest, including companions and debris disks. In this second paper of a series, we present follow-up observations of infrared excess candidates from Gaia and unWISE discussed in the first paper, Paper I. We report space-based infrared photometry at 3.6 and 4.5 micron for 174 white dwarfs from the Spitzer Space Telescope and ground-based near-infrared J, H, and K photometry of 235 white dwarfs from Gemini Observatory with significant overlap between Spitzer and Gemini observations. This data is used to confirm or rule-out the observed unWISE infrared excess. From the unWISE-selected candidate sample, the most promising infrared excess sample comes from both colour and flux excess, which has a Spitzer confirmation rate of 95\%. We also discuss a method to distinguish infrared excess caused by stellar or sub-stellar companions from potential dust disks. In total, we confirm the infrared excess around 61 white dwarfs, 10 of which are likely to be stellar companions. The remaining 51 bright white dwarf with infrared excess beyond two microns has the potential to double the known sample of white dwarfs with dusty exoplanetary debris disks. Follow-up high-resolution spectroscopic studies of a fraction of confirmed excess white dwarfs in this sample have discovered emission from gaseous dust disks. Additional investigations will be able to expand the parameter space from which dust disks around white dwarfs are found.},

	abstract = {Infrared excesses around metal-polluted white dwarfs have been associated with the accretion of dusty planetary material. This work analyses the available infrared data for an unbiased sample of white dwarfs and demonstrates that no more than 3.3 per cent can have a wide, flat, opaque dust disc, extending to the Roche radius, with a temperature at the disc inner edge of Tin = 1400 K, the standard model for the observed excesses. This is in stark contrast to the incidence of pollution of about 30 per cent. We present four potential reasons for the absence of an infrared excess in polluted white dwarfs, depending on their stellar properties and inferred accretion rates: (I) their dust discs are opaque, but narrow, thus evading detection if more than 85 per cent of polluted white dwarfs have dust discs narrower than δr {\textless} 0.04r, (II) their dust discs have been fully consumed, which only works for the oldest white dwarfs with sinking time-scales longer than hundreds of years, (III) their dust is optically thin, which can supply low accretion rates of {\textless}107 gs-1 if dominated by (Poynting-Robertson) PR-drag, and higher accretion rates, if inwards transport of material is enhanced, e.g. due to the presence of gas, (IV) their accretion is supplied by a pure gas disc, which could result from the sublimation of optically thin dust for T* {\textgreater} 20 000 K. Future observations sensitive to faint infrared excesses or the presence of gas can test the scenarios presented here, thereby better constraining the nature of the material fuelling accretion in polluted white dwarfs.},

The space density of white dwarfs is unchanged at 4.8 ± 0.5 × 10-3 pc-3. This new study includes a white dwarf mass distribution and luminosity function based on the 232 stars in the 25 pc sample. We find a significant excess of single stars over systems containing one or more companions (74 per cent versus 26 per cent). This suggests mechanisms that result in the loss of companions during binary system evolution. In addition, this updated sample exhibits a pronounced deficiency of nearby `Sirius-like' systems. 11 such systems were found within the 20 pc volume versus only one additional system found in the volume between 20 and 25 pc. An estimate of white dwarf birth rates during the last ∼8 Gyr is derived from individual remnant cooling ages. A discussion of likely ways new members of the local sample may be found is provided.},

The systems—including 41 with red dwarf primaries, 2 white dwarfs, and 1 brown dwarf—have trigonometric parallaxes greater than 100 mas, with errors of 0.4-2.4 mas in all but one case. We provide updated astrometric, photometric (VRIJHK magnitudes), spectral type, and multiplicity information here. Among these are 14 systems that are new entries to the 10 pc sample, including the first parallaxes for 9 systems and new values for 5 systems that had previous parallaxes with errors greater than 10 mas or values placing them beyond 10 pc. We also provide new data for 22 systems known to lie within 10 pc and 9 systems reported to be closer than that horizon but for which new parallaxes place them further away, bringing the total to 75 systems. The 44 systems added by RECONS comprise one of every 7 systems known within 10 pc. We illustrate the evolution of the 10 pc sample from the 191 systems known when the final Yale Parallax Catalog was published in 1995 to the 317 systems known today. Even so close to the Sun, additional discoveries of white, red, and brown dwarfs are possible, both as primaries and secondaries, although we estimate that at least 90\% of the stellar systems closer than 10 pc have now been identified.},

The comoving source has a projected separation of 130'', corresponding to 2500 AU at the distance of the primary (19.2 pc). If it is physically associated, then its absolute magnitude at 4.5 μm is {\textasciitilde}1 mag fainter than the faintest known T dwarfs, making it a strong candidate for the coolest known brown dwarf. The combination of M 4.5 and the age of the primary (1.5 Gyr) implies an effective temperature of {\textasciitilde}300 K and a mass of {\textasciitilde}7 M Jup according to theoretical evolutionary models. The white dwarf's progenitor likely had a mass of {\textasciitilde}2 M sun, and thus could have been born with a circumstellar disk that was sufficiently massive to produce a companion with this mass. Therefore, the companion could be either a brown dwarf that formed like a binary star or a giant planet that was born within a disk and has been dynamically scattered to a larger orbit.

From the results, empirical expressions are developed for both (1) the largest orbit around each of the stars and (2) the smallest orbit around the binary system as a whole, in which test particles survive the length of the integration (10{\textasciicircum}4 binary periods).

	abstract = {We analyze 8 years of precise radial velocity measurements from the Keck Planet Search, characterizing the detection threshold, selection effects, and completeness of the survey. We first carry out a systematic search for planets, by assessing the false-alarm probability associated with Keplerian orbit fits to the data. This allows us to understand the detection threshold for each star in terms of the number and time baseline of the observations, and the underlying “noise” from measurement errors, intrinsic stellar jitter, or additional low-mass planets. We show that all planets with orbital periods P {\textless} 2000 days, velocity amplitudes K {\textgreater} 20 m s-1, and eccentricities e ≲ 0.6 have been announced, and we summarize the candidates at lower amplitudes and longer orbital periods. For the remaining stars, we calculate upper limits on the velocity amplitude of a companion. For orbital periods less than the duration of the observations, these are typically 10 m s-1 and increase ∝ P2 for longer periods. We then use the nondetections to derive completeness corrections at low amplitudes and long orbital periods and discuss the resulting distribution of minimum mass and orbital period. We give the fraction of stars with a planet as a function of minimum mass and orbital period and extrapolate to long-period orbits and low planet masses. A power-law fit for planet masses {\textgreater}0.3 MJ and periods {\textless} 2000 days gives a mass-period distribution dN = CMα Pβ d ln Md ln P with α = -0.31 ± 0.2, β = 0.26 ± 0.1, and the normalization constant C such that 10.5\% of solar type stars have a planet with mass in the range 0.3-10 MJ and orbital period 2-2000 days. The orbital period distribution shows an increase in the planet fraction by a factor of ≈5 for orbital periods ≳300 days. Extrapolation gives 17\%-20\% of stars having gas giant planets within 20 AU. Finally, we constrain the occurrence rate of planets orbiting M dwarfs compared to FGK dwarfs, taking into account differences in detectability.},

	abstract = {Sirius, the seventh-nearest stellar system, is a visual binary containing the metallic-line A1 V star Sirius A, the brightest star in the sky, orbited in a 50.13 year period by Sirius B, the brightest and nearest white dwarf (WD). Using images obtained over nearly two decades with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), along with photographic observations covering almost 20 years and nearly 2300 historical measurements dating back to the 19th century, we determine precise orbital elements for the visual binary. Combined with the parallax and the motion of the A component, these elements yield dynamical masses of 2.063+/- 0.023 \{M\}⊙ and 1.018+/- 0.011 \{M\}⊙ for Sirius A and B, respectively. Our precise HST astrometry rules out third bodies orbiting either star in the system, down to masses of ∼15-25 \{M\}\{Jup\}. The location of Sirius B in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is in excellent agreement with theoretical cooling tracks for WDs of its dynamical mass, and implies a cooling age of ∼126 Myr. The position of Sirius B on the mass-radius plane is also consistent with WD theory, assuming a carbon-oxygen core. Including the pre-WD evolutionary timescale of the assumed progenitor, the total age of Sirius B is about 228 ± 10 Myr. We calculated evolutionary tracks for stars with the dynamical mass of Sirius A, using two independent codes. We find it necessary to assume a slightly subsolar metallicity, of about 0.85 \{Z\}⊙ , to fit its location on the luminosity-radius plane. The age of Sirius A based on these models is about 237-247 Myr, with uncertainties of ±15 Myr, consistent with that of the WD companion. We discuss astrophysical puzzles presented by the Sirius system, including the probability that the two stars must have interacted in the past, even though there is no direct evidence for this and the orbital eccentricity remains high.

However, the mid-IR (InfraRed) regime provides the optimum contrast to directly detect the thermal signatures of exoplanets in our solar neighbourhood. We aim to exploit novel fast chopping techniques newly developed for astronomy with the aid of adaptive optics to look for thermal signatures of exoplanets around bright stars in the solar neighbourhood. We use the upgraded VISIR (Very Large Telescope Imager and Spectrometer for the mid-InfraRed) instrument with high contrast imaging (HCI) capability optimized for observations at 10{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mu\$m to look for exoplanets around five nearby (\$d\$ {\textless} 4 pc) stars. The instrument provides an improved signal-to-noise (S/N) by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim\$4 in the N-band compared to standard VISIR for a given S/N and time. In this work we achieve a detection sensitivity of sub-mJy, which is sufficient to detect few Jupiter mass planets in nearby systems. Although no detections are made we achieve most sensitive limits within \${\textless}2''\$ for all the observed targets compared to previous campaigns. For \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Indi A and \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Eri we achieve detection limits very close to the giant planets discovered by RV, with the limits on \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Indi A being the most sensitive to date. Our non-detection therefore supports an older age for \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Indi A.

However, analysis of these data presents challenges due to the target's brightness and unique characteristics of the instrument. We present a comparison of dimensionality reduction techniques to construct background illumination maps for the whole detector using the areas of the detector that are not dominated by starlight.

Some of these polluted white dwarfs are found to have large mid-infrared excesses from close-in debris disks that are thought to be reservoirs for the metal accretion. These systems are coined DAZd white dwarfs. Here we investigate the claims of Bonnet-Bidaud \& Pantin that Sirius B, the nearest white dwarf to the Sun, might have an infrared excess from a dusty debris disk. Sirius B's companion, Sirius A, is commonly observed as a mid-infrared photometric standard in the Southern hemisphere. We combine several years of Gemini/T-ReCS photometric standard observations to produce deep mid-infrared imaging in five {\textasciitilde}10 μm filters (broad N + four narrow band), which reveal the presence of Sirius B. Our photometry is consistent with the expected photospheric emission such that we constrain any mid-infrared excess to lsim10\% of the photosphere. Thus, we conclude that Sirius B does not have a large dusty disk, as seen in DAZd white dwarfs.

Jupiter, in particular, might end up more highly irradiated than the hot Neptune GJ 436b and, hence, could appropriately be termed a "hot Jupiter." When their stars go through the RGB or asymptotic giant branch stages, many of the currently known Jupiter-mass planets in several-AU orbits will receive levels of irradiation comparable to the hot Jupiters, which will transiently increase their atmospheric temperatures to {\textasciitilde}1000 K or more. Furthermore, massive planets around post-main-sequence stars could accrete a non-negligible amount of material from the enhanced stellar winds, thereby significantly altering their atmospheric chemistry as well as causing a significant accretion luminosity during the epochs of most intense stellar mass loss. Future generations of infrared observatories might be able to probe the thermal and chemical structure of such hot Jupiters' atmospheres. Finally, we argue that, unlike their main-sequence analogs (whose zonal winds are thought to be organized in only a few broad, planetary-scale jets), red-giant hot Jupiters should have multiple, narrow jets of zonal winds and efficient day-night redistribution.},

Keck II 10 m telescope's adaptive optics camera (NIRC2) in its narrow field mode. For the first time, this distortion model is constructed from on-sky measurements and is made available to the public in the form of FITS files. When applied to widely dithered images, it produces residuals in the separations of stars that are a factor of {\textasciitilde}3 smaller compared with the outcome using previous models. By applying this new model, along with corrections for differential atmospheric refraction, to widely dithered images of SiO masers at the Galactic center (GC), we improve our ability to tie into the precisely measured radio Sgr A*-rest frame. The resulting infrared reference frame is {\textasciitilde}2-3 times more accurate and stable than earlier published efforts. In this reference frame, Sgr A* is localized to within a position of 0.6 mas and a velocity of 0.09 mas yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, or {\textasciitilde}3.4 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} at 8 kpc (1σ). Also, proper motions for members of the central stellar cluster are more accurate, although less precise, due to the limited number of these wide field measurements. These proper motion measurements show that, with respect to Sgr A*, the central stellar cluster has no rotation in the plane of the sky to within 0.3 mas yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} arcsec{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, has no net translational motion with respect to Sgr A* to within 0.1 mas yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, and has net rotation perpendicular to the plane of the sky along the Galactic plane, as has previously been observed. While earlier proper motion studies defined a reference frame by assuming no net motion of the stellar cluster, this approach is fundamentally limited by the cluster's intrinsic dispersion and therefore will not improve with time. We define a reference frame with SiO masers and this reference frame's stability should improve steadily with future measurements of the SiO masers in this region (vpropt {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3/2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}). This is essential for achieving the necessary reference frame stability required to detect the effects of general relativity and extended mass on short-period stars at the GC.},

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

This includes classical algorithms such as ridge regression, Newton's method, and Kalman filter, as well as modern deep-learning algorithms such as stochastic-gradient descent, RMSprop, and Dropout. The key idea in deriving such algorithms is to approximate the posterior using candidate distributions estimated by using natural gradients. Different candidate distributions result in different algorithms and further approximations to natural gradients give rise to variants of those algorithms.

We present the results of a benchmark trial comparing various cosmic ray rejection algorithms. The procedures assess relative performances and characteristics of the processes in cosmic ray detection, rates of false detections of true objects, and the quality of image cleaning and reconstruction. The cosmic ray rejection algorithms developed by Rhoads (2000, PASP, 112, 703), van Dokkum (2001, PASP, 113, 1420), Pych (2004, PASP, 116, 148), and the IRAF task XZAP by Dickinson are tested using both simulated and real data. It is found that detection efficiency is independent of the density of cosmic rays in an image, being more strongly affected by the density of real objects in the field. As expected, spurious detections and alterations to real data in the cleaning process are also significantly increased by high object densities. We find the Rhoads' linear filtering method to produce the best performance in the detection of cosmic ray events; however, the popular van Dokkum algorithm exhibits the highest overall performance in terms of detection and cleaning.},

	abstract = {We present an optimized algorithm that removes cosmic rays ("CRs") from multi-orbit HST Wide Field/Planetary Camera ("WF/PC") images. It computes the image noise in every iteration from the WF/PC CCD equation. This includes all known sources of random and systematic calibration errors. We test this algorithm on WF/PC stacks of 2-12 orbits as a function of the number of available orbits and the formal Poissonian sigma-clipping level. We find that the algorithm needs {\textgreater}= 4 WF/PC exposures to locate the minimal sky-signal (which is noticably affected by CRs), with an optimal clipping level at 2-2.5 x sigma\_Poisson. We analyze the CR flux detected on multi-orbit "CR stacks", which are constructed by subtracting the best CR filter images from the unfiletered 8-12 orbit average. We use an automated object finder to determine the surface density of CRs as a function of the apparent magnitude (or ADU flux) they would have generated in the images had they not been removed. The power law slope of the CR "counts" (gamma {\textasciitilde}= 0.6 for N(m) approaching m{\textasciicircum}gamma) is steeper than that of the faint galaxy counts down to V {\textasciitilde}= 28 mag. The CR counts show a drop off between 28 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 30 mag (the latter is our formal 2-sigma point source sensitivity without spherical aberration). This prevents the CR sky integral from diverging, and is likely due to a real cut-off in the CR energy distribution below {\textasciitilde}11 ADU per orbit. The integral CR surface denisty is {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}8 deg{\textasciicircum}-2 and their sky-signal is V{\textasciitilde}= 25.5-27.0 mag arcsec{\textasciicircum}-2 or 3-13\% of our NEP sky background (V=23.3 mag arcsec{\textasciicircum}-2), and well above the EBL integral of the deepest galaxy counts (B\_J {\textasciitilde}= 28.0 mag arcsec{\textasciicircum}-2). We conclude that faint CRs will always contribute to the sky-signal in the deepest WF/PC images. Since WFPC2 has \_2.7 x lower read-noise and a thicker CCDs, this will result in more CR detections than in WF/PC, potentially affecting {\textasciitilde}10-20\% of the pixels in multi-orbit WFPC2 data cubes.

Corresponding to scales of 10s of milli-arcseconds, these observations pose a huge technical challenge due to the high angular-resolutions and contrasts required. A major stumbling block is the problem of the Earth's own atmospheric turbulence. The other difficulty is that precise calibration is required to combat the extremely high contrast ratios and high resolutions faced. By taking advantage of the fact that starlight scattered by dust in the circumstellar region is polarized, differential polarimetry can help achieve this calibration.

Every Strehl ratio measurement algorithm has subtle differences that result in different measured values. This creates problems when comparing different measurements of the same AO system and even more problems when trying to compare results from different systems. To determine how much the various algorithm difference actually impacted the measured values, we created a series of simulated point spread functions (PSF). The simulated PSFs were then sent around to the various members of the project who then measured the Strehl ratio. The measurements were done blindly, with no knowledge of the true Strehl ratio. We then compared the various measurements to the truth values. Each measurement cycle turned up impacts which were further investigated in the next cycle. We present the results of our comparisons showing the scatter in measured Strehl ratios and our best recommendations for computing an accurate Strehl ratio.},

The subtraction of an imperfect model from a continuously sampled spectrum introduces covariance between adjacent datapoints (pixels) into the residual spectrum. For the high signal-to-noise data with large spectral range that is commonly employed in stellar astrophysics, that covariant structure can lead to dramatically underestimated parameter uncertainties (and, in some cases, biases). We construct a likelihood function that accounts for the structure of the covariance matrix, utilizing the machinery of Gaussian process kernels. This framework specifically addresses the common problem of mismatches in model spectral line strengths (with respect to data) due to intrinsic model imperfections (e.g., in the atomic/molecular databases or opacity prescriptions) by developing a novel local covariance kernel formalism that identifies and self-consistently downweights pathological spectral line “outliers.” By fitting many spectra in a hierarchical manner, these local kernels provide a mechanism to learn about and build data-driven corrections to synthetic spectral libraries. An open-source software implementation of this approach is available at http://iancze.github.io/Starfish, including a sophisticated probabilistic scheme for spectral interpolation when using model libraries that are sparsely sampled in the stellar parameters. We demonstrate some salient features of the framework by fitting the high-resolution V-band spectrum of WASP-14, an F5 dwarf with a transiting exoplanet, and the moderate-resolution K-band spectrum of Gliese 51, an M5 field dwarf.},

The PyWFS is at its most sensitive when it is used without modulation of the input beam. In nonmodulated mode, the device is highly nonlinear. Hence, all PyWFS implementations on current AAO systems employ modulation to make the device more linear. The upcoming era of 30-m class telescopes and the demand for ultra-precise wavefront control stemming from science objectives that include direct imaging of exoplanets make using the PyWFS without modulation desirable. This article argues that nonlinear estimation based on Newton\&\#x2019;s method for nonlinear optimization can be useful for mitigating the effects of nonlinearity in the nonmodulated PyWFS. The proposed approach requires all optical modeling to be pre-computed, which has the advantage of avoiding real-time simulations of beam propagation. Further, the required real-time calculations are amenable to massively parallel computation. Numerical experiments simulate a PyWFS with faces sloped 3.7\&\#x00B0; to the horizontal, operating at a wavelength of 0.85\&\#x00A0;\&\#x03BC;m, and with an index of refraction of 1.45. A singular value analysis shows that the common practice of calculating two \&\#x201C;slope\&\#x201D; images from the four PyWFS pupil images discards critical information and is unsuitable for the nonmodulated PyWFS simulated here. Instead, this article advocates estimators that use the raw pixel values not only from the four geometrical images of the pupil, but from surrounding pixels as well. The simulations indicate that nonlinear estimation can be effective when the Strehl ratio of the input beam is greater than 0.3, and the improvement relative to linear estimation tends to increase at larger Strehl ratios. At Strehl ratios less than about 0.5, the performances of both the nonlinear and linear estimators are relatively insensitive to noise since they are dominated by nonlinearity error.},

	abstract = {The Planetary Systems Imager (PSI) is a modular instrument optimized for direct imaging and characterization of exoplanet and disks with the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). PSI will operate across a wide wavelength range (\&asymp;0.6 - 5\&mu;m) to image exoplanets and circumstellar disks in both reflected light and thermal emission. Thanks to the TMT’s large collecting area, PSI will have the sensitivity to directly image and spectrally characterize large gaseous planets with unprecedented sensitivity. PSI will also be capable of imaging rocky planets in the habitable zones of the nearest M-type stars in reflected light and search for biomarkers in their atmospheres. Imaging habitable planets in reflected light is PSI’s most challenging goal, requiring high contrast imaging (HCI) capabilities well beyond what current instruments achieve. This science goal drives PSI’s wavefront sensing and control requirements and defines the corresponding architecture discussed in this paper. We show that PSI must deliver 1e-5 image contrast \&asymp;15 mas separation at \&lambda; \&asymp; 1\&mu;m-1.5\&mu;m, and that a conventional extreme-AO architecture relying on a single high speed wavefront sensor (WFS) is not sufficient to meet this requirement. We propose a wavefront control architecture relying on both visible light (\&lambda; \&lt; 1.1 \&mu;m) sensing to optimize sensitivity, and near-IR (\&lambda; \&gt; 1.1 \&mu;m) sensors to address wavefront chromaticity terms and provide high contrast imaging capability. We show that this combination will enable speckle halo suppression at the \&lt; 1e-5 raw contrast level in near-IR, allowing detection and spectroscopic characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby M-type stars.},

	abstract = {Very precise measurements of exoplanet transit light curves both from 
ground- and space-based observatories make it now possible to fit the
limb-darkening coefficients in the transit-fitting procedure rather than
fix them to theoretical values. This strategy has been shown to give
better results, as fixing the coefficients to theoretical values can
give rise to important systematic errors which directly impact the
physical properties of the system derived from such light curves such as
the planetary radius. However, studies of the effect of limb-darkening
assumptions on the retrieved parameters have mostly focused on the
widely used quadratic limb-darkening law, leaving out other proposed
laws that are either simpler or better descriptions of model intensity
profiles. In this work, we show that laws such as the logarithmic,
square-root and three-parameter law do a better job that the quadratic
and linear laws when deriving parameters from transit light curves, both
in terms of bias and precision, for a wide range of situations. We
therefore recommend to study which law to use on a case-by-case basis.
We provide code to guide the decision of when to use each of these laws
and select the optimal one in a mean-square error sense, which we note
has a dependence on both stellar and transit parameters. Finally, we
demonstrate that the so-called exponential law is non-physical as it
typically produces negative intensities close to the limb and should
therefore not be used.},

	abstract = {The search for exoplanets is pushing adaptive optics systems on ground-based telescopes to their limits. One of the major limitations at small angular separations, exactly where exoplanets are predicted to be, is the servo-lag of the adaptive optics systems. The servo-lag error can be reduced with predictive control where the control is based on the future state of the atmospheric disturbance. We propose to use a linear data-driven integral predictive controller based on subspace methods that is updated in real time. The new controller only uses the measured wavefront errors and the changes in the deformable mirror commands, which allows for closed-loop operation without requiring pseudo-open loop reconstruction. This enables operation with non-linear wavefront sensors such as the pyramid wavefront sensor. We show that the proposed controller performs near-optimal control in simulations for both stationary and non-stationary disturbances and that we are able to gain several orders of magnitude in raw contrast. The algorithm has been demonstrated in the lab with MagAO-X, where we gain more than two orders of magnitude in contrast.},

We summarize here a novel method for training deep neural networks for predictive control based on an adversarial prior. Unlike previous methods in the literature, which have shown results based on previously generated data or for open-loop systems, we demonstrate our network's performance simulated in closed loop. Our models are able to both reduce effects induced by servo-lag and push the faint end of reliable control with natural guidestars, improving K-band Strehl performance compared to classical methods by over 55\% for 16th magnitude guide stars on an 8-meter telescope. We further show that LSTM based approaches may be better suited in high-contrast scenarios where servo-lag error is most pronounced, while traditional feed forward models are better suited for high noise scenarios.

One technical obstacle to using nested sampling in practice is the requirement that prior distributions be provided in the form of bijective transformations from the unit hyper-cube to the target prior density. For many applications - particularly when using the posterior from one experiment as the prior for another - such a transformation is not readily available. In this letter we show that parametric bijectors trained on samples from a desired prior density provide a general-purpose method for constructing transformations from the uniform base density to a target prior, enabling the practical use of nested sampling under arbitrary priors. We demonstrate the use of trained bijectors in conjunction with nested sampling on a number of examples from cosmology.},

	abstract = {High-quality astronomical images delivered by modern ground-based and space observatories demand adequate, reliable software for their analysis and accurate extraction of sources, filaments, and other structures, containing massive amounts of detailed information about the complex physical processes in space. The multi-wavelength observations with highly variable angular resolutions across wavebands require extraction tools that preserve and use the invaluable high-resolution information. This paper presents getsf, a new method for extracting sources and filaments in astronomical images using separation of their structural components, designed to handle multi-wavelength sets of images and very complex filamentary backgrounds. The method spatially decomposes the original images and separates the structural components of sources and filaments from each other and from their backgrounds, flattening their resulting images. It spatially decomposes the flattened components, combines them over wavelengths, detects the positions of sources and skeletons of filaments, and measures the detected sources and filaments. This paper presents a realistic multi-wavelength set of simulated benchmark images that can serve as the standard benchmark problem to evaluate qualities of source and filament extraction methods. This paper describes hires, an improved algorithm for the derivation of high-resolution surface densities from the multi-wavelength far-infrared Herschel images. The algorithm allows creation of the surface densities with angular resolutions reaching 5.6 arcsec, when using the 70 micron image. Both getsf and hires are illustrated by their applications to a variety of images, from the X-ray domain to the millimeter wavelengths.},

We are able to constrain the eccentricities of 51 systems with a single transiting planet, which supplement our previous measurements of 66 planets in multi-planet systems. Through a Bayesian hierarchical analysis, we find evidence that systems with only one detected transiting planet have a different eccentricity distribution than systems with multiple detected transiting planets. The eccentricity distribution of the single-transiting systems is well described by the positive half of a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a dispersion \${\textbackslash}sigma\_e = 0.32 {\textbackslash}pm 0.06\$, while the multiple-transit systems are consistent with \${\textbackslash}sigma\_e = 0.083{\textasciicircum}\{+0.015\}\_\{-0.020\}\$. A mixture model suggests a fraction of \$0.76{\textasciicircum}\{+0.21\}\_\{-0.12\}\$ of single-transiting systems have a moderate eccentricity, represented by a Rayleigh distribution that peaks at \$0.26{\textasciicircum}\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.06\}\$. This finding may reflect differences in the formation pathways of systems with different numbers of transiting planets. We investigate the possibility that eccentricities are "self-excited" in closely packed planetary systems, as well as the influence of long-period giant companion planets. We find that both mechanisms can qualitatively explain the observations. We do not find any evidence for a correlation between eccentricity and stellar metallicity, as has been seen for giant planets. Neither do we find any evidence that orbital eccentricity is linked to the detection of a companion star. Along with this paper we make available all of the parameters and uncertainties in the eccentricity distributions, as well as the properties of individual systems, for use in future studies.},

Several properties of the Beta distribution make it a powerful tool for this purpose. For example, the Beta distribution can reproduce a diverse range of probability density functions (PDFs) using just two shape parameters (a and b). We argue that this makes it ideal for serving as a parametric model in Bayesian comparative population analysis. The Beta distribution is also uniquely defined over the interval zero to unity, meaning that it can serve as a proper prior for eccentricity when analysing the observations of bound extrasolar planets. Using nested sampling, we find that the distribution of eccentricities for 396 exoplanets detected through radial velocity with high signal-to-noise is well-described by a Beta distribution with parameters a = 0.867+/-0.044 and b = 3.03+/-0.17. The Beta distribution is shown to be 3.7 times more likely to represent the underlying distribution of exoplanet eccentricities than the next best model: a Rayleigh + exponential distribution. The same data are also used in an example population comparison utilizing the Beta distribution, where we find that the short- and long-period planets are described by distinct Beta distributions at a confidence of 11.6 sigma and display a signature consistent with the effects of tidal circularization.},

	abstract = {Stellar limb darkening affects a wide range of astronomical measurements and is frequently modelled with a parametric model using polynomials in the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the emergent intensity. Two-parameter laws are particularly popular for cases where one wishes to fit freely for the limb darkening coefficients (i.e. an uninformative prior) due to the compact prior volume and the fact that more complex models rarely obtain unique solutions with present data. In such cases, we show that the two limb darkening coefficients are constrained by three physical boundary conditions, describing a triangular region in the two-dimensional parameter space. We show that uniformly distributed samples may be drawn from this region with optimal efficiency by a technique developed by computer graphical programming: triangular sampling. Alternatively, one can make draws using a uniform, bivariate Dirichlet distribution. We provide simple expressions for these parametrizations for both techniques applied to the case of quadratic, square-root and logarithmic limb darkening laws. For example, in the case of the popular quadratic law, we advocate fitting for q\_1 = (u\_1+u\_2){\textasciicircum}2 and q\_2 = 0.5u\_1(u\_1+u\_2){\textasciicircum}\{-1\} with uniform priors in the interval [0,1] to implement triangular sampling easily. Employing these parametrizations allows one to derive model parameters which fully account for our ignorance about the intensity profile, yet never explore unphysical solutions, yielding robust and realistic uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, in the case of triangular sampling with the quadratic law, our parametrization leads to significantly reduced mutual correlations and provides an alternative geometric explanation as to why naively fitting the quadratic limb darkening coefficients precipitates strong correlations in the first place.},

	abstract = {The Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) standard has been a great boon to astronomy, allowing observatories, scientists and the public to exchange astronomical information easily. The FITS standard, however, is showing its age. Developed in the late 1970s, the FITS authors made a number of implementation choices that, while common at the time, are now seen to limit its utility with modern data. The authors of the FITS standard could not anticipate the challenges which we are facing today in astronomical computing. Difficulties we now face include, but are not limited to, addressing the need to handle an expanded range of
specialized data product types (data models), being more conducive to the networked exchange and storage of data, handling very large
datasets, and capturing significantly more complex metadata and data relationships.

There are members of the community today who find some or all of these limitations unworkable, and have decided to move ahead with storing data in other formats. If this fragmentation continues, we risk abandoning the advantages of broad interoperability, and ready archivability, that the FITS format provides for astronomy. In this paper we detail some selected important problems which exist within the FITS standard today. These problems may provide insight into deeper underlying issues which reside in the format and we provide a discussion of some lessons learned. It is not our intention here to prescribe specific remedies to these issues; rather, it is to call attention of the FITS and greater astronomical computing communities to these problems in the hope that it will spur action to address them.},

	abstract = {The use of Gaussian processes (GPs) as models for astronomical time 
series datasets has recently become almost ubiquitous, given their ease
of use and flexibility. GPs excel in particular at marginalization over
the stellar signal in cases where the variability due to starspots
rotating in and out of view is treated as a nuisance, such as in
exoplanet transit modeling. However, these effective models are less
useful in cases where the starspot signal is of primary interest since
it is not obvious how the parameters of the GP model are related to the
physical properties of interest, such as the size, contrast, and
latitudinal distribution of the spots. Instead, it is common practice to
explicitly model the effect of individual starspots on the light curve
and attempt to infer their properties via optimization or posterior
inference. Unfortunately, this process is degenerate, ill-posed, and
often computationally intractable when applied to stars with more than a
few spots and/or to ensembles of many light curves. In this paper, we
derive a closed-form expression for the mean and covariance of a
Gaussian process model that describes the light curve of a rotating,
evolving stellar surface conditioned on a given distribution of starspot
sizes, contrasts, and latitudes. We demonstrate that this model is
correctly calibrated, allowing one to robustly infer physical parameters
of interest from one or more stellar light curves, including the typical
radii and the mean and variance of the latitude distribution of
starspots. Our GP has far-ranging implications for understanding the
variability and magnetic activity of stars from both light curves and
radial velocity (RV) measurements, as well as for robustly modeling
correlated noise in both transiting and RV exoplanet searches. Our
implementation is efficient, user-friendly, and open source, available
as the Python package starry-process.},

	abstract = {In recent years, dedicated extreme-precision radial velocity (EPRV)
spectrographs have produced vast quantities of high-resolution,
high-signal-to-noise time-series spectra for bright stars. These data contain
valuable information for the dual purposes of planet detection via the measured
RVs and stellar characterization via the co-added spectra. However,
considerable data analysis challenges exist in extracting these data products
from the observed spectra at the highest possible precision, including the
issue of poorly-characterized telluric absorption features and the common use
of an assumed stellar spectral template. In both of these examples,
precision-limiting reliance on external information can be sidestepped using
the data directly. Here we propose a data-driven method to simultaneously
extract precise RVs and infer the underlying stellar and telluric spectra using
a linear model (in the log of flux). The model employs a convex objective and
convex regularization to keep the optimization of the spectral components fast.
We implement this method in wobble, an open-source python package which uses
TensorFlow in one of its first non-neural-network applications to astronomical
data. In this work, we demonstrate the performance of wobble on archival HARPS
spectra. We recover the canonical exoplanet 51 Pegasi b, detect the secular RV
evolution of the M dwarf Barnard's Star, and retrieve the Rossiter-McLaughlin
effect for the Hot Jupiter HD 189733b. The method additionally produces
extremely high-S/N composite stellar spectra and detailed time-variable
telluric spectra, which we also present here.},

	abstract = {Since its debut by John Skilling in 2004, nested sampling has proven a valuable tool to the scientist, providing hypothesis evidence
calculations and parameter inference for complicated posterior
distributions, particularly in the field of astronomy. Due to its computational complexity and long-running nature, in the past, nested sampling has been reserved for offline-type Bayesian inference, leaving tools such as variational inference and MCMC for online-type,
time-constrained, Bayesian computations. These tools do not easily handle complicated multi-modal posteriors, discrete random variables, and posteriors lacking gradients, nor do they enable practical
calculations of the Bayesian evidence. An opening thus remains for a high-performance out-of-the-box nested sampling package that can close the gap in computational time, and let nested sampling become common place in the data science toolbox. We present JAX-based nested sampling (JAXNS), a high-performance nested sampling package written in
XLA-primitives using JAX, and show that it is several orders of

microlensing. For each method, this chapter first derives or summarizes
the basic observable phenomena that are used to infer the existence of
planetary companions as well as the physical properties of the planets
and host stars that can be derived from the measurement of these
signals. This chapter then outlines the general experimental
requirements to robustly detect the signals using each method, by
comparing their magnitude to the typical sources of measurement
uncertainty. This chapter goes on to compare the various methods to each
other by outlining the regions of planet and host star parameter space
where each method is most sensitive, stressing the complementarity of
the ensemble of the methods at our disposal. Finally, there is a brief
review of the history of the young exoplanet field, from the first
detections to current state-of-the-art surveys for rocky worlds.},

	abstract = {Starlight subtraction algorithms based on the method of 
Karhunen-Loève eigenimages have proved invaluable to exoplanet
direct imaging. However, they scale poorly in runtime when paired with
differential imaging techniques. In such observations, reference frames
and frames to be starlight-subtracted are drawn from the same set of
data, requiring a new subset of references (and eigenimages) for each
frame processed to avoid self-subtraction of the signal of interest. The
data rates of extreme adaptive optics instruments are such that the only
way to make this computationally feasible has been to downsample the
data. We develop a technique that updates a pre-computed singular value
decomposition of the full dataset to remove frames (i.e. a "downdate")
without a full recomputation, yielding the modified eigenimages. This
not only enables analysis of much larger data volumes in the same amount
of time, but also exhibits near-linear scaling in runtime as the number
of observations increases. We apply this technique to archival data and
investigate its scaling behavior for very large numbers of frames \$N\$.
The resulting algorithm provides speed improvements of \$2.6{\textbackslash}times\$ (for
200 eigenimages at \$N = 300\$) to \$140 {\textbackslash}times\$ (at \$N = 10{\textasciicircum}4\$) with the
advantage only increasing as \$N\$ grows. This algorithm has allowed us to
substantially accelerate KLIP even for modest \$N\$, and will let us
quickly explore how KLIP parameters affect exoplanet characterization in
large \$N\$ datasets.},

	abstract = {Heretofore, the literature on exoplanet detection with coronagraphic 
telescope systems has paid little attention to the information content
of short exposures and methods of utilizing the measurements of adaptive
optics wavefront sensors. This paper provides a framework for the
incorporation of the wavefront sensor measurements in the context of
observing modes in which the science camera takes millisecond exposures.
In this formulation, the wavefront sensor measurements provide a means
to jointly estimate the static speckle and the planetary signal. The
ability to estimate planetary intensities in as little as a few seconds
has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of exoplanet search
surveys. For simplicity, the mathematical development assumes a simple
optical system with an idealized Lyot coronagraph. Unlike currently used
methods, in which increasing the observation time beyond a certain
threshold is useless, this method produces estimates whose error
covariances decrease more quickly than inversely proportional to the
observation time. This is due to the fact that the estimates of the
quasi-static aberrations are informed by a new random (but approximately
known) wavefront every millisecond. The method can be extended to
include angular (due to diurnal field rotation) and spectral diversity.
Numerical experiments are performed with wavefront data from the AEOS
Adaptive Optics System sensing at 850 nm. These experiments assume a
science camera wavelength λ of 1.1 μ, that the measured
wavefronts are exact, and a Gaussian approximation of shot-noise. The
effects of detector read-out noise and other issues are left to future
investigations. A number of static aberrations are introduced, including
one with a spatial frequency exactly corresponding the planet location,
which was at a distance of ≈3λ/D from the star. Using only 4 s
of simulated observation time, a planetary intensity, of ≈1 photon
ms-1, and a stellar intensity of ≈105
photons ms-1 (contrast ratio 105), the
short-exposure estimation method recovers the amplitudes' static
aberrations with 1\% accuracy, and the planet brightness with 20\%
accuracy.},

Frazin (ApJ, 2013) introduced a post-processing algorithm demonstrating that simultaneous millisecond exposures in the science camera and wavefront sensor (WFS) can be used with a statistical inference procedure to determine both the series expanded NCPA coefficients and the planetary signal. We demonstrate, via simulation, that using this algorithm in a closed-loop AO system, real-time estimation and correction of the quasi-static NCPA is possible without separate deformable mirror (DM) probes. Thus the use of this technique allows for the removal of the quasi-static speckles that can be mistaken for planetary signals without the need for new optical hardware, improving the efficiency of ground-based exoplanet detection. In our simulations, we explore the behavior of the Frazin Algorithm (FA) and the dependence of its convergence to an accurate estimate on factors such as Strehl ratio, NCPA strength, and number of algorithm search basis functions. We then apply this knowledge to simulate running the algorithm in real-time in a nearly ideal setting. We then discuss adaptations that can be made to the algorithm to improve its real-time performance, and show their efficacy in simulation. A final simulation tests the technique's resilience against imperfect knowledge of the AO residual phase, motivating an analysis of the feasibility of using this technique in a real closed-loop Extreme AO system such as SCExAO or MagAO-X, in terms of computational complexity and the accuracy of the estimated quasi-static NCPA correction.},

Simultaneous (\${\textbackslash}sim\$ millisecond) exposures by the science camera and the AO system enable the use of "phase diversity" to estimate both the NCPAs and the scene via a processing procedure first described by the author (R. Frazin 2013, ApJ, 767, article id. 21). This method is fully compatible with more standard concepts used in long-exposure high-contrast imaging, such as angular differential imaging and spectral deconvolution. Long-exposure methods find time-dependent NCPAs, such as those caused by vibrations, particularly challenging. Here, an NCPA of the form of \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}cos(k {\textbackslash}cdot r - {\textbackslash}omega t + {\textbackslash}vartheta)\$ is considered. It is shown that, when sampled at millisecond time-scales, the image plane data are sensitive to \${\textbackslash}mbox\{arg\}({\textbackslash}alpha)\$, \${\textbackslash}vartheta\$ and \${\textbackslash}omega\$, and, therefore such NCPAs can be simultaneously estimated with the scene. Simulations of observations with ms exposure times are reported. These simulations include substantial detector noise and a sinusoidal NCPA that places a speckle exactly at the location of a planet. Simulations show that the effects of detector noise can be mitigated by mixing exposures of various lengths, allowing estimation of the planet's brightness.},

In order to improve accuracy on key science observables, such as photometry and astrometry, alternative methods are investigated, such as PSF reconstruction (PSF-R), designed to estimate the PSF from AO control-loop data and key atmosphere and system parameters. We aim in this paper at retrieving directly these relevant inputs we need to reconstruct the PSF using an hybrid approach, that couples AO telemetry with focal plane images, named as Focal plane profiling and reconstruction (FPPR). It adjusts atmosphere parameters (the C$^{\textrm{2}}$$_{\textrm{n}}$ (h) profile) and optical gains in the system.

	abstract = {Context. Beyond the choice of wavefront control systems or coronographs, 
advanced data processing methods play a crucial role in disentangling
potential planetary signals from bright quasi-static speckles. Among
these methods, angular differential imaging (ADI) for data sets obtained
in pupil tracking mode (ADI sequences) is one of the foremost research
avenues, considering the many observing programs performed with
ADI-based techniques and the associated discoveries. Aims:
Inspired by the field of econometrics, here we propose a new detection
algorithm for ADI sequences, deriving from the regime-switching model
first proposed in the 1980s. Methods: The proposed model is very
versatile as it allows the use of PSF-subtracted data sets (residual
cubes) provided by various ADI-based techniques, separately or together,
to provide a single detection map. The temporal structure of the
residual cubes is used for the detection as the model is fed with a
concatenated series of pixel-wise time sequences. The algorithm provides
a detection probability map by considering two possible regimes for
concentric annuli, the first one accounting for the residual noise and
the second one for the planetary signal in addition to the residual
noise. Results: The algorithm performance is tested on data sets
from two instruments, VLT/NACO and VLT/SPHERE. The results show an
overall better performance in the receiver operating characteristic
space when compared with standard signal-to-noise-ratio maps for several
state-of-the-art ADI-based post-processing algorithms.},

	abstract = {High-contrast imaging surveys for exoplanet detection have shown giant planets at large separations to be rare. It is important to push towards detections at smaller separations, the part of the parameter space containing most planets. The performance of traditional methods for post-processing of pupil-stabilized observations decreases at smaller separations, due to the larger field-rotation required to displace a source on the detector in addition to the intrinsic difficulty of higher stellar contamination. We developed a method of extracting exoplanet signals that improves performance at small angular separations. A data-driven model of the temporal behavior of the systematics for each pixel can be created using reference pixels at a different position, assuming the underlying causes of the systematics are shared across multiple pixels. This is mostly true for the speckle pattern in high-contrast imaging. In our causal regression model, we simultaneously fit the model of a planet signal "transiting" over detector pixels and non-local reference lightcurves describing a basis of shared temporal trends of the speckle pattern to find the best fitting temporal model describing the signal. With our implementation of a spatially non-local, temporal systematics model, called TRAP, we show that it is possible to gain up to a factor of 6 in contrast at close separations (\${\textless}3{\textbackslash}lambda/D\$) compared to a model based on spatial correlations between images displaced in time. We show that better temporal sampling resulting in significantly better contrasts. At short integration times for \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pic data, we increase the SNR of the planet by a factor of 4 compared to the spatial systematics model. Finally, we show that the temporal model can be used on unaligned data which has only been dark and flat corrected, without the need for further pre-processing.},

It is important to achieve the highest possible sensitivity to faint sources such as planets, using both hardware and data analysis software. While analytic methods are efficient, real systems are better-modelled numerically, but such models with many parameters can be hard to understand, optimize and apply. Automatic differentiation software developed for machine learning now makes calculating derivatives with respect to aberrations
straightforward for arbitrary optical systems. We apply this powerful new tool to enhance high-angular-resolution astronomical imaging. Self-calibrating observables such as the 'closure phase' or 'bispectrum' have been widely used in optical and radio astronomy to mitigate optical aberrations and achieve high-fidelity imagery. Kernel phases are a generalization of closure phases in the limit of small phase errors. Using automatic differentiation, we reproduce existing kernel phase theory within this framework and demonstrate an extension to the Lyot coronagraph, finding self-calibrating combinations of speckles which are resistant to phase noise, but only in the very high-wavefront-quality regime. As an illustrative example, we reanalyze Palomar adaptive optics observations of the binary alpha Ophiuchi, finding consistency between the new pipeline and the existing standard. We present a new Python package 'morphine' that incorporates these ideas, with an interface similar to the popular package poppy, for optical simulation with automatic differentiation.

To optimize the performance of the algorithm, we conduct extensive

signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the recovered planets. We show that only
two spectral templates are necessary to recover any young Jovian

false positives, and completeness contours. We process in a uniform

point sources into the science images, which we then try to recover with
maximum S/N. This improves the S/N of real point sources elsewhere in
the field. The algorithm, based on the locally optimized combination of
images (LOCI) method, is called Matched LOCI or MLOCI. We show with
Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) data on HD 135344 B and Near-Infrared
Coronagraphic Imager (NICI) data on several stars that the new algorithm
can improve the S/N of point source detections by 30-400\% over past
methods. We also find no increase in false detections rates. No prior
knowledge of candidate companion locations is required to use MLOCI. On
the other hand, while non-blind applications may yield linear
combinations of science images that seem to increase the S/N of true
sources by a factor {\textgreater}2, they can also yield false detections at high
rates. This is a potential pitfall when trying to confirm marginal
detections or to redetect point sources found in previous epochs. These
findings are relevant to any method where the coefficients of the linear
combination are considered tunable, e.g., LOCI and principal component

	abstract = {Rigorously quantifying the information in high-contrast imaging data is important for informing follow-up strategies to confirm the substellar nature of a point source, constraining theoretical models of
planet-disk interactions, and deriving planet occurrence rates.
However, within the exoplanet direct imaging community, non-detections have almost exclusively been defined using a frequentist detection threshold (i.e., contrast curve) and associated completeness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a Bayesian
framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a parameter lies below this limit with a certain probability. The
associated probability is the integral of the posterior distribution with the upper limit as the upper bound. In summary, a frequentist upper limit is a statement about the detectability of planets while a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about the probability of a parameter to lie in an interval given the data. The latter is therefore better suited for rejecting hypotheses or theoretical models based on their predictions. In this work we emphasize that Bayesian statistics and upper limits are more easily interpreted and typically more constraining than the frequentist approach. We illustrate the use of Bayesian analysis in two different cases: (1) with a known planet location where we also propose to use model comparison to constrain the astrophysical nature of the point source and (2) gap-carving planets in TW Hya. To finish, we also mention the problem of combining radial velocity and direct imaging observations.},

	abstract = {To directly image exoplanets and faint circumstellar disks, the noisy 
stellar halo must be suppressed to a high level. To achieve this feat,
the angular differential imaging observing technique and the
least-squares Locally Optimized Combination of Images (LOCI) algorithm
have now become the standard in single band direct imaging observations
and data reduction. With the development and commissioning of new
high-order high-contrast adaptive optics equipped with integral field
units, the image subtraction algorithm needs to be modified to allow the
optimal use of polychromatic images, field-rotated images and archival
data. A new algorithm, TLOCI (for Template LOCI), is designed to achieve
this task by maximizing a companion signal-to-noise ratio instead of
simply minimizing the noise as in the original LOCI algorithm. The TLOCI
technique uses an input spectrum and template Point Spread Functions
(PSFs, generated from unocculted and unsaturated stellar images) to
optimize the reference image least-squares coefficients to minimize the
planet self-subtraction, thus maximizing its throughput per wavelength,
while simultaneously providing a maximum suppression of the speckle
noise. The new algorithm has been developed using on-sky GPI data and
has achieved impressive contrast. This paper presents the TLOCI
algorithm, on-sky performance, and will discuss the challenges in
recovering the planet spectrum with high fidelity.},

To allow detection of faint planets, images from these observing techniques are combined in a way to retain the planet flux while subtracting as much as possible the residual speckle noise. The LOCI algorithm is a very efficient way of combining a set of reference images to subtract the noise of a given image. Although high contrast performances have been achieved with ADI/SSDI/RSDI \& LOCI, achieving high accuracy photometry and astrometry can be a challenge, due to various biases coming mainly from the inevitable partial point source self-subtraction for ADI/SSDI and how LOCI is designed to suppress the noise. We present here several biases that we hare uncovered while analyzing data on the HR8799 planetary system and how we have modified our analysis pipeline to calibrate or remove these effects so that high accuracy astrometry and photometry is achievable. In addition, several new upgrades are presented in a new archive-based (i.e. performing ADI, SSDI and RSDI with LOCI as a single PSF subtraction step) multi-instrument reduction and analysis pipeline called SOSIE.},

	abstract = {Context. The detection of exoplanets by direct imaging is an active 
research topic in astronomy. Even with the coupling of an extreme
adaptive-optics system with a coronagraph, it remains challenging due to
the very high contrast between the host star and the exoplanets. 
Aims: The purpose of this paper is to describe a method, named PACO,
dedicated to source detection from angular differential imaging data.
Given the complexity of the fluctuations of the background in the
datasets, involving spatially variant correlations, we aim to show the
potential of a processing method that learns the statistical model of
the background from the data. Methods: In contrast to existing
approaches, the proposed method accounts for spatial correlations in the
data. Those correlations and the average stellar speckles are learned
locally and jointly to estimate the flux of the (potential) exoplanets.
By preventing from subtracting images including the stellar speckles
residuals, the photometry is intrinsically preserved. A nonstationary
multi-variate Gaussian model of the background is learned. The decision
in favor of the presence or the absence of an exoplanet is performed by
a binary hypothesis test. Results: The statistical accuracy of
the model is assessed using VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS datasets. It is shown to
capture the nonstationarity in the data so that a unique threshold can
be applied to the detection maps to obtain consistent detection
performance at all angular separations. This statistical model makes it
possible to directly assess the false alarm rate, probability of
detection, photometric and astrometric accuracies without resorting to
Monte-Carlo methods. Conclusions: PACO offers appealing
characteristics: it is parameter-free and photometrically unbiased. The
statistical performance in terms of detection capability, photometric
and astrometric accuracies can be straightforwardly assessed. A fast
approximate version of the method is also described that can be used to
process large amounts of data from exoplanets search surveys.},

	abstract = {Context. The direct detection of exoplanets with high-contrast imaging 
requires advanced data processing methods to disentangle potential
planetary signals from bright quasi-static speckles. Among them, angular
differential imaging (ADI) permits potential planetary signals with a
known rotation rate to be separated from instrumental speckles that are
either statics or slowly variable. The method presented in this paper,
called ANDROMEDA for ANgular Differential OptiMal Exoplanet Detection
Algorithm, is based on a maximum likelihood approach to ADI and is used
to estimate the position and the flux of any point source present in the
field of view. Aims: In order to optimize and experimentally
validate this previously proposed method, we applied ANDROMEDA to real
VLT/NaCo data. In addition to its pure detection capability, we
investigated the possibility of defining simple and efficient criteria
for automatic point source extraction able to support the processing of
large surveys. Methods: To assess the performance of the method,
we applied ANDROMEDA on VLT/NaCo data of TYC-8979-1683-1 which is
surrounded by numerous bright stars and on which we added synthetic
planets of known position and flux in the field. In order to accommodate
the real data properties, it was necessary to develop additional
pre-processing and post-processing steps to the initially proposed
algorithm. We then investigated its skill in the challenging case of a
well-known target, β Pictoris, whose companion is close to the
detection limit and we compared our results to those obtained by another
method based on principal component analysis (PCA). Results:
Application on VLT/NaCo data demonstrates the ability of ANDROMEDA to
automatically detect and characterize point sources present in the image
field. We end up with a robust method bringing consistent results with a
sensitivity similar to the recently published algorithms, with only two
parameters to be fine tuned. Moreover, the companion flux estimates are
not biased by the algorithm parameters and do not require a posteriori
corrections. Conclusions: ANDROMEDA is an attractive alternative
to current standard image processing methods that can be readily applied
to on-sky data.

observing technique. VIP implements functionalities for building high-contrast data processing pipelines, encompassing pre- and
post-processing algorithms, potential source position and flux
estimation, and sensitivity curve generation. Among the reference point-spread function subtraction techniques for ADI post-processing, VIP includes several flavors of principal component analysis (PCA) based algorithms, such as annular PCA and incremental PCA algorithms capable of processing big datacubes (of several gigabytes) on a computer with limited memory. Also, we present a novel ADI algorithm based on
non-negative matrix factorization, which comes from the same family of low-rank matrix approximations as PCA and provides fairly similar results. We showcase the ADI capabilities of the VIP library using a deep sequence on HR 8799 taken with the LBTI/LMIRCam and its recently commissioned L-band vortex coronagraph. Using VIP, we investigated the presence of additional companions around HR 8799 and did not find any significant additional point source beyond the four known planets. VIP

obtaining milliarcsecond astrometry to constrain exoplanet orbits.
However, astrometry of directly imaged exoplanets is subject to biases,
systematic errors, and speckle noise. Here, we describe an analytical
procedure to forward model the signal of an exoplanet that accounts for
both the observing strategy (angular and spectral differential imaging)
and the data reduction method (Karhunen-Loève Image
Projection algorithm). We use this forward model to measure the position
of an exoplanet in a Bayesian framework employing Gaussian processes and
Markov-chain Monte Carlo to account for correlated noise. In the case of
GPI data on β Pic b, this technique, which we call Bayesian KLIP-FM
Astrometry (BKA), outperforms previous techniques and yields 1σ
errors at or below the one milliarcsecond level. We validate BKA by
fitting a Keplerian orbit to 12 GPI observations along with previous
astrometry from other instruments. The statistical properties of the
residuals confirm that BKA is accurate and correctly estimates
astrometric errors. Our constraints on the orbit of β Pic b firmly
rule out the possibility of a transit of the planet at 10-σ
significance. However, we confirm that the Hill sphere of β Pic b
will transit, giving us a rare chance to probe the circumplanetary
environment of a young, evolving exoplanet. We provide an ephemeris for
photometric monitoring of the Hill sphere transit event, which will
begin at the start of April in 2017 and finish at the end of January in

	abstract = {The work presented here attempts at answering the question: how do we decide when a given adetection is a planet or just residual noise in exoplanet direct imaging data? To this end we present a method
implemented within a Bayesian framework: (1) to unify 'source
detection', and, 'source characterization' into one single rigorous mathematical framework; (2) to enable an adequate hypothesis testing given the S/N of the data; (3) to enhance the detectability of planets faint signal in the presence of instrumental and background noise and to optimize the characterization of the planet. As a proof of concept we implemented a routine named \$\{{\textbackslash}tt PlanetEvidence\}\$ that integrates the nested sampling technique (Multinest) with a post-processing technique, the Karhunen-Loeve Image Processing (KLIP), algorithm. This is a first step to recast such post-processing method into a fully Bayesian perspective. We test our approach on real direct imaging data,
specifically using GPI data of \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pictoris b, and, on synthetic data. We find that for the former the method strongly favors the presence of a planet (as expected) and recovers the true parameter posterior distributions. While for the latter case our approach allows us to detect (true) dim sources invisible to the naked eye as real planets, rather than background noise, and set a new lower threshold for detection at the 2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ level approximately. Further it allows us to quantify our confidence that a given detection is a real planet and not just residual noise (for example residual speckles). The next natural step is to extend this approach to construct a Bayesian-based algorithm for blind detection, that is, not requiring an initial guess as to the location of the planet.

owing to the small angular separation and high contrast between
exoplanets and their host stars. High Dispersion Coronagraphy (HDC) is a
pathway to achieve unprecedented sensitivity to Earth-like planets in
the habitable zone. Here, we present a framework to simulate HDC
observations and data analyses. The goal of these simulations is to
perform a detailed analysis of the trade-off between raw star light
suppression and spectral resolution for various instrument
configurations, target types, and science cases. We predict the
performance of an HDC instrument at Keck observatory for characterizing
directly imaged gas-giant planets in near-infrared bands. We also
simulate HDC observations of an Earth-like planet using next-generation
ground-based (TMT) and spaced-base telescopes (HabEx and LUVOIR). We
conclude that ground-based ELTs are more suitable for HDC observations
of an Earth-like planet than future space-based missions owing to the
considerable difference in collecting area. For ground-based telescopes,
HDC observations can detect an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone
around an M-dwarf star at 10-4 star light suppression
level. Compared to the 10-7 planet/star contrast, HDC
relaxes the star light suppression requirement by a factor of
103. For space-based telescopes, detector noise will be a
major limitation at spectral resolutions higher than 104.
Considering detector noise and speckle chromatic noise, R = 400 (1600)
is the optimal spectral resolutions for HabEx (LUVOIR). The
corresponding star light suppression requirement to detect a planet with
planet/star contrast = 6.1× \{10\}-11 is relaxed by a
factor of 10 (100) for HabEx (LUVOIR).},

The heart of the SPHERE instrument is its eXtreme Adaptive Optics (XAO) SAXO (SPHERE AO for eXoplanet Observation) subsystem that provides extremely high correction of turbulence and very accurate stabilization of images for coronagraphic purpose. However, SAXO, as well as the overall instrument, must also provide constant operability overnights, ensuring robustness and autonomy. An original control scheme has been developed to satisfy this challenging dichotomy. It includes in particular both an Optimized Modal Gain Integrator (OMGI) to control the Deformable Mirror (DM) and a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control law to manage the tip-tilt (TT) mirror. LQG allows optimal estimation and prediction of turbulent angle of arrival but also of possible vibrations. A specific and unprecedented control scheme has been developed to continuously adapt and optimize LQG control ensuring a constant match to turbulence and vibrations characteristics. SPHERE is thus the first operational system implementing LQG, with automatic adjustment of its models. SAXO has demonstrated performance beyond expectations during tests in Europe, in spite of internal limitations. Very first results have been obtained on sky last May. We thus come back to SAXO control scheme, focusing in particular on the LQG based TT control and the various upgrades that have been made to enhance further the performance ensuring constant operability and robustness.

resulting image shows faint features, only revealed with this
combination, such as the wind driven halo. The wind driven halo is due
to the lag between the adaptive optics correction and the turbulence
speed over the telescope pupil. However, we observe an asymmetry of this
wind driven halo that was not expected when the instrument was designed.
In this letter, we describe and demonstrate the physical origin of this
asymmetry and support our explanation by simulating the asymmetry with
an end-to-end approach. From this work, we find that the observed
asymmetry is explained by the interference between the AO-lag error and
scintillation effects, mainly originating from the fast jet stream layer
located at about 12 km in altitude. Now identified and interpreted, this
effect can be taken into account for further design of high-contrast
imaging simulators, next generation or upgrade of high-contrast

	abstract = {Context. For high-contrast imaging systems, such as VLT/SPHERE, the 
performance of the system at small angular separations is contaminated
by the wind-driven halo in the science image. This halo is a result of
the servo-lag error in the adaptive optics (AO) system due to the finite
time between measuring the wavefront phase and applying the phase
correction. One approach to mitigating the servo-lag error is predictive
control. Aims: We aim to estimate and understand the potential
on-sky performance that linear data-driven prediction would provide for
VLT/SPHERE under various turbulence conditions. Methods: We used
a linear minimum mean square error predictor and applied it to 27
different AO telemetry data sets from VLT/SPHERE taken over many nights
under various turbulence conditions. We evaluated the performance of the
predictor using residual wavefront phase variance as a performance
metric. Results: We show that prediction always results in a
reduction in the temporal wavefront phase variance compared to the
current VLT/SPHERE AO performance. We find an average improvement factor
of 5.1 in phase variance for prediction compared to the VLT/SPHERE
residuals. When comparing to an idealised VLT/SPHERE, we find an
improvement factor of 2.0. Under our 27 different cases, we find the
predictor results in a smaller spread of the residual temporal phase
variance. Finally, we show there is no benefit to including spatial
information in the predictor in contrast to what might have been
expected from the frozen flow hypothesis. A purely temporal predictor is
best suited for AO on VLT/SPHERE. Conclusions: Linear prediction
leads to a significant reduction in phase variance for VLT/SPHERE under
a variety of observing conditions and reduces the servo-lag error.
Furthermore, prediction improves the reliability of the AO system
performance, making it less sensitive to different conditions.},

wavefront sensors (PWFSs) over the traditional Shack-Hartmann sensor in
the quest for increased sensitivity, peak performance and ultimate

means to highlight its properties and applications. We explore forward
models for the PWFS in the spatial-frequency domain: these prove useful
because (I) they emanate directly from physical-optics (Fourier)
diffraction theory; (II) they provide a straightforward path to
meaningful error breakdowns; (III) they allow for reconstruction
algorithms with  \$O (n{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}log(n))\$  complexity for large-scale systems;
and (IV) they tie in seamlessly with decoupled (distributed) optimal
predictive dynamic control for performance and contrast optimization.
All these aspects are dealt with here. We focus on recent analytical
PWFS developments and demonstrate the performance using both analytic
and end-to-end simulations. We anchor our estimates on observed on-sky
contrast on existing systems, and then show very good agreement between
analytical and Monte Carlo performance estimates on AO systems featuring
the PWFS. For a potential upgrade of existing high-contrast imagers on
10-m-class telescopes with visible or near-infrared PWFSs, we show,
under median conditions at Paranal, a contrast improvement (limited by
chromatic and scintillation effects) of 2×-5× when just
replacing the wavefront sensor at large separations close to the AO
control radius where aliasing dominates, and of factors in excess of
10× by coupling distributed control with the PWFS over most of the
AO control region, from small separations starting with an inner working
angle of typically 1-2 λ/D to the AO correction edge (here 20

limit performance. Under the frozen flow hypothesis linear predictive
control techniques can overcome this; however, identification and

required for such parametric techniques. This can complicate practical
implementations and introduce stability issues when encountering
variable conditions. Here, we present a non-linear wavefront predictor
using a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network (ANN)
that assumes no prior knowledge of the atmosphere and thus requires no
user input. The ANN is designed to predict the open-loop wavefront slope
measurements of a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SH-WFS) one frame in
advance to compensate for a single-frame delay in a simulated 7 ×
7 single-conjugate adaptive optics system operating at 150 Hz. We
describe how the training regime of the LSTM ANN affects prediction
performance and show how the performance of the predictor varies under
various guide star magnitudes. We show that the prediction remains
stable when both wind speed and direction are varying. We then extend
our approach to a more realistic two-frame latency system. AO system
performance when using the LSTM predictor is enhanced for all simulated

We propose an optimal linear approach based on the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) framework commonly employed for atmospheric predictions. The approach offers increased robustness and significant performance advantages over previously proposed wavefront prediction algorithms. It can be implemented as a linear pattern matching algorithm, which decomposes in real time the input (most recent wavefront sensor measurements) into a linear sum of previously encountered patterns, and uses the coefficients of this linear expansion to predict the future state. The process is robust against evolving conditions, unknown spatio-temporal correlations and non-periodic transient events, and enables multiple sensors (for example accelerometers) to contribute to the wavefront estimation. We illustrate the EOFs advantages through numerical simulations, and demonstrate filter convergence within 1 minute on a 1 kHz rate system. We show that the EOFs approach provides significant gains in high contrast imaging by simultaneously reducing residual speckle halo and producing a residual speckle halo that is spatially and temporally uncorrelated.},

	abstract = {Direct imaging of exoplanets is a challenging task as it requires to 
reach a high contrast at very close separation to the star. Today, the
main limitation in the high-contrast images is the quasi-static speckles
that are created by residual instrumental aberrations. They have the
same angular size as planetary companions and are often brighter, hence
hindering our capability to detect exoplanets. Dedicated observation
strategies and signal processing techniques are necessary to disentangle
these speckles from planetary signals. The output of these methods is a
detection map in which the value of each pixel is related to a
probability of presence of a planetary signal. The detection map found
in the literature relies on the assumption that the residual noise is
Gaussian. However, this is known to lead to higher false positive rates,
especially close to the star. In this paper, we re-visit the notion of
detection map by analysing the speckle noise distribution, namely the
Modified Rician distribution. We use non-asymptotic analysis of the sum
of random variables to show that the tail of the distribution of the
residual noise decays as an exponential distribution, hence explaining
the high false detection rate obtained with the Gaussian assumption.
From this analysis, we introduce a novel time domain detection map and
we demonstrate its capabilities and the relevance of our approach
through experiments on real data. We also provide an empirical rule to
determine detection threshold providing a good trade-off between true
positive and false positive rates for exoplanet detection.},

To meet these challenges, ground-based telescopes must be equipped with extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) systems optimized to acquire high-contrast images of the immediate surrounding of nearby bright stars.

for those time lags using previous wavefront measurements, thereby
improving the raw contrast in the post-coronagraphic science focal

Functions (EOF) has previously been proposed and demonstrated on
Subaru/SCExAO. In this paper we present initial tests of this method for
application to the near-infrared pyramid wavefront sensor (PYWFS)

commissioning of the PYWFS. We discuss how the performance varies as
different temporal and spatial scales are included in the computation of
the predictive filter. We further describe the implementation of EOF

We test the validity of this representation of AO correction by comparing our simulations with recent K-band data from the 241 channel Palomar Hale AO system and its dedicated Palomar High Angular Resolution Observer (PHARO) science camera in coronagraphic mode. Our choice of monochromatic modeling enables us to distinguish between underlying halo suppression and bright Airy ring suppression in the final coronagraphic images. For a given telescope-AO system combination, we find that AO systems delivering images with Strehl ratios below a threshold value are not well suited to diffraction-limited coronagraphs. When Strehl ratios are above this threshold, an optimized coronagraph with occulting image plane stops as small as 4λ/D creates a

	abstract = {Context. The detection of exoplanets by direct imaging is very 
challenging. It requires an extreme adaptive-optics (AO) system and a
coronagraph as well as suitable observing strategies. In angular
differential imaging, the signal-to-noise ratio is improved by combining
several observations. Aims: Due to the evolution of the
observation conditions and of the AO correction, the quality of the
observations may vary significantly during the observing sequence. It is
common practice to reject images of comparatively poor quality. We aim
to decipher when this selection should be performed and what its impact
on detection performance is. Methods: Rather than discarding a
full image, we study the local fluctuations of the signal at each frame
and derive weighting maps for each frame. These fluctuations are modeled
locally directly from the data through the spatio-temporal covariance of
small image patches. The weights derived from the temporal variances can
be used to improve the robustness of the detection step and reduce
estimation errors of both the astrometry and photometry. The impact of
bad frames can be analyzed by statistically characterizing the detection
and estimation performance. Results: When used together with a
modeling of the spatial covariances (PACO algorithm), these weights
improve the robustness of the detection method. Conclusions: The
spatio-temporal modeling of the background fluctuations provides a way
to exploit all acquired frames. In the case of bad frames, areas with
larger fluctuations are discarded by a weighting strategy and do not
corrupt the detection map or the astrometric and photometric
estimations. Other areas of better quality are preserved and are
included to detect and characterize sources.},

	abstract = {Context. Exoplanet detection and characterization by direct imaging both 
rely on sophisticated instruments (adaptive optics and coronagraph) and
adequate data processing methods. Angular and spectral differential
imaging (ASDI) combines observations at different times and a range of
wavelengths in order to separate the residual signal from the host star
and the signal of interest corresponding to off-axis sources. 
Aims: Very high contrast detection is only possible with an accurate
modeling of those two components, in particular of the background due to
stellar leakages of the host star masked out by the coronagraph. Beyond
the detection of point-like sources in the field of view, it is also
essential to characterize the detection in terms of statistical
significance and astrometry and to estimate the source spectrum. 
Methods: We extend our recent method PACO, based on local learning of
patch covariances, in order to capture the spectral and temporal
fluctuations of background structures. From this statistical modeling,
we build a detection algorithm and a spectrum estimation method: PACO
ASDI. The modeling of spectral correlations proves useful both in
reducing detection artifacts and obtaining accurate statistical
guarantees (detection thresholds and photometry confidence intervals).
 Results: An analysis of several ASDI datasets from the
VLT/SPHERE-IFS instrument shows that PACO ASDI produces very clean
detection maps, for which setting a detection threshold is statistically
reliable. Compared to other algorithms used routinely to exploit the
scientific results of SPHERE-IFS, sensitivity is improved and many false
detections can be avoided. Spectrally smoothed spectra are also produced
by PACO ASDI. The analysis of datasets with injected fake planets
validates the recovered spectra and the computed confidence intervals.
 Conclusions: PACO ASDI is a high-contrast processing algorithm
accounting for the spatio-spectral correlations of the data to produce
statistically-grounded detection maps and reliable spectral estimations.
Point source detections, photometric and astrometric characterizations
are fully automatized.},

	abstract = {Imaging circumstellar disks in the near-infrared provides unprecedented information about the formation and evolution of planetary systems. However, current post-processing techniques for high-contrast imaging have a limited sensitivity to extended signals and their morphology is often plagued with strong morphological distortions. Moreover, it is challenging to disentangle planetary signals from the disk when the two components are closed or intertwined. We propose a pipeline that is capable of detecting a wide variety of disks and preserving their shapes and flux distributions. By construction, our approach separates planets from disks. After analyzing the distortions induced by the current angular differential imaging (ADI) post-processing techniques, we establish a direct model of the different components constituting a temporal sequence of high-contrast images. In an inverse problem framework, we jointly estimate the starlight residuals and the potential extended sources and point sources hidden in the images, using low-complexity priors for each signal. To verify and estimate the performance of our approach, we tested it on VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS data, in which we injected synthetic disks and planets. We also applied our approach on observations containing real disks. Our technique makes it possible to detect disks from ADI datasets of a contrast above \$3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$ with respect to the host star. As no specific shape of the disks is assumed, we are capable of extracting a wide diversity of disks, including face-on disks. The intensity distribution of the detected disk is accurately preserved and point sources are distinguished, even close to the disk.},

	abstract = {A new class of high-contrast image analysis algorithms that empirically fit and subtract systematic noise has lead to recent discoveries of faint exoplanet /substellar companions and scattered light images of circumstellar disks. These methods are extremely efficient at enhancing the detectability of faint astrophysical signal, but they do generally create systematic biases in their observed properties. This paper provides a general solution for this outstanding problem. We present the analytical derivation of a linear expansion that captures the impact of astrophysical over-subtraction and/or self-subtraction these image analysis techniques. We examine the general case for which the reference images of the astrophysical scene move azimuthally and/or radially across the field of view as a result of the observation strategy. Our new method is based on perturbing the covariance matrix underlying any least-squares speckles problem, and propagating this perturbation through the data analysis algorithm. We then demonstrate practical applications of this new algorithm. We first consider the case of the spectral extraction of faint point sources in IFS data and illustrate, using public Gemini Planet Imager commissioning data, that our novel perturbation-based Karhunen-Lo{\textbackslash}`eve Image Processing Forward Modeling (KLIP-FM) can indeed alleviate algorithmic biases. We then apply KLIP-FM to the problem associated with the detection of point sources. We show how it decreases the rate of false negatives (e.g missed planets) while keeping the rate of false positives unchanged when compared to classical least-squares fitting methods. This can potentially have important consequences on the design of follow-up strategies of ongoing direct imaging surveys.},

	abstract = {Context. Data processing constitutes a critical component of 
high-contrast exoplanet imaging. Its role is almost as important as the
choice of a coronagraph or a wavefront control system, and it is
intertwined with the chosen observing strategy. Among the data
processing techniques for angular differential imaging (ADI), the most
recent is the family of principal component analysis (PCA) based
algorithms. It is a widely used statistical tool developed during the
first half of the past century. PCA serves, in this case, as a subspace
projection technique for constructing a reference point spread function
(PSF) that can be subtracted from the science data for boosting the
detectability of potential companions present in the data.
Unfortunately, when building this reference PSF from the science data
itself, PCA comes with certain limitations such as the sensitivity of
the lower dimensional orthogonal subspace to non-Gaussian noise. 
Aims: Inspired by recent advances in machine learning algorithms such as
robust PCA, we aim to propose a localized subspace projection technique
that surpasses current PCA-based post-processing algorithms in terms of
the detectability of companions at near real-time speed, a quality that
will be useful for future direct imaging surveys. Methods: We
used randomized low-rank approximation methods recently proposed in the
machine learning literature, coupled with entry-wise thresholding to
decompose an ADI image sequence locally into low-rank, sparse, and
Gaussian noise components (LLSG). This local three-term decomposition
separates the starlight and the associated speckle noise from the
planetary signal, which mostly remains in the sparse term. We tested the
performance of our new algorithm on a long ADI sequence obtained on
β Pictoris with VLT/NACO. Results: Compared to a standard
PCA approach, LLSG decomposition reaches a higher signal-to-noise ratio
and has an overall better performance in the receiver operating
characteristic space. This three-term decomposition brings a
detectability boost compared to the full-frame standard PCA approach,
especially in the small inner working angle region where complex speckle
noise prevents PCA from discerning true companions from noise.},

can be reduced by subtraction of reference PSF images. We have developed
an algorithm to construct an optimized reference PSF image from a set of
reference images. This image is built as a linear combination of the
reference images available, and the coefficients of the combination are
optimized inside multiple subsections of the image independently to
minimize the residual noise within each subsection. The algorithm
developed can be used with many high-contrast imaging observing
strategies relying on PSF subtraction, such as angular differential
imaging (ADI), roll subtraction, spectral differential imaging, and
reference star observations. The performance of the algorithm is
demonstrated for ADI data. It is shown that for this type of data the
new algorithm provides a gain in sensitivity by up to a factor of 3 at
small separation over the algorithm previously used by Marois and
colleagues.

	abstract = {Angular differential imaging is a high-contrast imaging technique that reduces quasistatic speckle noise and facilitates the detection of nearby companions. A sequence of images is acquired with an
altitude/azimuth telescope while the instrument field derotator is switched off. This keeps the instrument and telescope optics aligned and allows the field of view to rotate with respect to the instrument. For each image, a reference point-spread function (PSF) is constructed from other appropriately selected images of the same sequence and subtracted to remove quasistatic PSF structure. All residual images are then rotated to align the field and are combined. Observed performances are reported for Gemini North data. It is shown that quasistatic PSF noise can be reduced by a factor {\textasciitilde}5 for each image subtraction. The
combination of all residuals then provides an additional gain of the order of the square root of the total number of acquired images. A total speckle noise attenuation of 20-50 is obtained for a 1 hr long observing sequence compared to a single 30 s exposure. A PSF noise attenuation of 100 was achieved for a 2 hr long sequence of images of Vega, reaching a 5 σ contrast of 20 mag for separations greater than 8". For a 30 minute long sequence, ADI achieves signal-to-noise ratios 30 times better than a classical observation technique. The ADI technique can be used with currently available instruments to search for
{\textasciitilde}1MJup exoplanets with orbits of radii between 50 and 300 AU around nearby young stars. The possibility of combining the technique with other high-contrast imaging methods is briefly discussed.

Such observations, combined with detailed theoretical models and inverse methods, provide valuable insights into a wide range of physical processes and chemical compositions in exoplanetary atmospheres.

In many contexts (i.e., stellar time-series, or high-contrast imaging, or stellar spectroscopy), there are structured components in this noise caused by systematic effects in the
astronomical source, the atmosphere, the telescope, or the detector. More often than not, evaluation of the true physical model for these nuisances is computationally intractable and dependent on too many (unknown) parameters to allow rigorous probabilistic inference.
Sometimes, housekeeping data---and often the science data
themselves---can be used as predictors of the systematic noise. Linear combinations of simple functions of these predictors are often used as computationally tractable models that can capture the nuisances. These models can be used to fit and subtract systematics prior to
investigation of the signals of interest, or they can be used in a simultaneous fit of the systematics and the signals. In this Note, we show that if a Gaussian prior is placed on the weights of the linear components, the weights can be marginalized out with an operation in pure linear algebra, which can (often) be made fast. We illustrate this model by demonstrating the applicability of a linear model for the non-linear systematics in K2 time-series data, where the dominant noise source for many stars is spacecraft motion and variability.},

Parallax uncertainties are in the range of up to 0.04 milliarcsecond for sources at G{\textless}15, around 0.1mas for sources with G=17 and at the faint end, the uncertainty is of the order of 0.7mas at G=20. The corresponding uncertainties in the respective proper motion components are up to 0.06mas/yr (for G{\textless}15mag), 0.2mas/yr (for G=17mag) and 1.2mas/yr (for G=20mag). The Gaia DR2 parallaxes and proper motions are based only on Gaia data; they do no longer depend on the Tycho-2 Catalogue.

Median radial velocities (i.e. the median value over the epochs) for more than 6 million stars with a mean G magnitude between about 4 and 13 and an effective temperature (Teff) in the range of about 3550 to 6900K. This leads to a full six-parameter solution: positions and motions on the sky with parallaxes and radial velocities, all combined with mean G magnitudes. The overall precision of the radial velocities at the bright end is in the order of 200-300m/s while at the faint end the overall precision is approximately 1.2km/s for a Teff of 4750K and about 2.5km/s for a Teff of 6500K.

An additional set of more than 200 million sources for which a
two-parameter solution is available: the positions on the sky

milli-mag at G=20. Please be aware that the photometric system for the G band in Gaia DR2 will be different from the photometric system as used in Gaia DR1.

GBP and GRP magnitudes for more than 1.1 billion sources, with precisions varying from a few milli-mag at the bright (G{\textless}13) end to around 200 milli-mag at G=20.

When looking close to the star, the number of resolution elements decreases rapidly towards small angles. This reduction of the number of degrees of freedom dramatically aﬀects CLs and false alarm probabilities. Naively using the same ideal hypothesis and methods as for larger separations, which are well understood and commonly assume Gaussian noise, can yield up to one order of magnitude error in contrast estimations at ﬁxed CL. The statistical penalty exponentially increases towards very small inner working angles. Even at 5-10 resolution elements from the star, false alarm probabilities can be signiﬁcantly higher than expected. Here we present a rigorous statistical analysis which ensures robustness of the CL, but also imposes a substantial limitation on corresponding achievable detection limits (thus contrast) at small angles. This unavoidable fundamental statistical eﬀect has a signiﬁcant impact on current coronagraphic and future high contrast imagers. Finally, the paper concludes with practical recommendations to account for small number statistics when computing the sensitivity to companions at small angles and when exploiting the results of direct imaging planet surveys.},
