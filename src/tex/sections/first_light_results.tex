\section{First Light Results}\label{sec:firstlight}

The VAMPIRES upgrades were tested on-sky from June to August 2023, some results from our first-light observations are presented below.

\subsection{HD 169142\label{sec:hd169142}}

We observed the young star \textit{HD 169142}, which is a known protoplanetary disk host, on \formatdate{7}{7}{2023}. We used the multiband imaging mode without the FLC (slow polarimetry mode) with the \SI{105}{\mas} Lyot coronagraph for \SI{55}{minutes}, resulting in \SI{47}{minutes} of data- roughly an \SI{85}{\%} observing efficiency. We reduced this data as described in \autoref{sec:processing} with background subtraction and double-difference polarimetric reduction with an idealized Mueller-matrix correction. We used an annulus from \ang{;;0.24} to \ang{;;0.33} for removing residual instrumental polarization since this matches the expected region of the cavity of the disk \citep{bertrang_hd_2018}. We convert the data from \si{adu} to \si{mJy/arcsec^2} using a synthetic photometry of a standard F2V model spectrum \citep{pickles_stellar_1998} normalized to V=\SI{7.978}{mag} \citep{zacharias_fourth_2013}. We note that using an idealized Mueller matrix is not optimal, but future analysis will be done when the upgraded instrument polarization calibration is completed.

The $Q_\phi$ frames from each filter, which we use to represent the polarized intensity, are shown in \autoref{fig:hd169142_mosaic}. The inner disk is visible at all wavelengths. We also show a version scaled by the squared stellocentric distance to normalize the stellar irradiation. The scaled version shows the large disk gap and the inner rim of the outer disk. We note that compared to images from \cite{bertrang_hd_2018} we have worse S/N and do not fully resolve the outer disk. However, our observations have smaller spectral bandwidth per image and use a fraction of the detector integration time (\SI{1}{s} versus \SIrange{6}{10}{s}). Future observations with longer detector integration times are needed to resolve the full disk structure.

We take each $Q_\phi$ frame and integrate the flux out to \ang{;;1} and compare to the same flux value measured in the Stokes I frame. The relative fluxes for each filter are shown in \autoref{fig:hd169142_flux}. The mean integrated partial-polarization of the disk, \SI{0.6}{\%}, roughly matches the expectations given similar measurements from TODO and TODO.

\end{figure}

In future work we plan to model and fit geometric disk profiles to analyze the scattering geometry of this disk, allowing a measurement of the scattering phase function of the dust at multiple wavelengths. These measurements give us color information about the scattering properties of the dust which normally requires multiple observations for each filter, but we obtain them in a one observing sequence by using the multiband imaging technique.

\subsection{R Aqr\label{sec:raqr}}

We performed narrowband H$\alpha$ observations of the Mira variable \textit{R Aqr} on \formatdate{27}{6}{2023} with VAMPIRES. We decided to slightly increase our observing efficiency by not switching the differential filters between each camera- we were not concerned with non-common path aberrations for this short demonstration sequence.

For each camera (and therefore each narrowband filter) we reduced the data following \autoref{sec:processing} with dark subtraction and phase cross-correlation centroiding. We derotate all images to north up east left before coadding with a pixel-by-pixel median. We use calibration factors from \autoref{tbl:filters} and the detector gain and exposure time to convert data from \si{adu} into units of \si{mJy/arcsec^2}. The collapsed images are shown in \autoref{fig:raqr}.

\subsection{Neptune\label{sec:neptune}}

We observed gas giant \textit{Neptune} on \formatdate{11}{7}{2023} in the multiband imaging mode to test VAMPIRES capabilities for planetary astromony. \textit{Neptune} was a good target due to its angular diameter being within the VAMPIRES FOV ($<$\ang{;;3}) and without being too faint. The adaptive optics systems during this observation were not able to correct for wavefront errors with the typical performance due to the lack of a point-source guide star- rather using the extended planet itself as a guide star. In addition, this data requires slight modifications in the post-processing to address the unique features of a planetary image.

For processing, we attempted flat-field correction with some success. Multiband observations are uniquely difficult to flat field, because a single detector image has four images at different wavelengths, and therefore different intensities when illuminated with a calibration laser or flat lamp. We developed a simple computer-vision algorithm to fit rotated rectangles to each flat-field and normalizes each field with a local value. Unfortunately, in this data there was a bug in the FITS writing software which truncated all data to 15-bit unsigned integers, making data artificially saturated if the readout value was $>2^{15}$. This has been fixed but our calibration flats for the F720 filter all suffer from this truncation, leading to large flat field errors (as can be seen in \autoref{fig:neptune_mosaic}). We also discovered some imperfect flat-field correction of some dust features in other fields, likely due to small differences in the optical alignment of the glass fieldstop.

We did not attempt to centroid this data, instead we registered each frame using the field positions fit during our flat-field procedure. Future work would benefit from more precise centroiding, perhaps using a radon transform to fit the disk position for each image. Similar to \autoref{sec:hd169142} we perform double-difference polarimetric reduction with an idealized Mueller-matrix correction. We also attempted to model and subtract the instrumental polarization using an annulus past the edge of the planet, but we note this area is very close to the edge of the field and may be slightly contaminated by the planet. We derotate all Stokes images to north up and east left before combining with a pixel-by-pixel median. We calculate an alternative set of radial Stokes parameters, $Q_r$ and $U_r$, following \citet{schmid_limb_2006},
\begin{align}
    Q_r &= Q\cos{\left(2\theta\right)} + U\sin{\left(2\theta\right)} \\
    U_r &= -Q\sin{\left(2\theta\right)} + U\cos{\left(2\theta\right)}
\end{align}
For planetary atmospheres we can use $Q_r$ as the polarized intensity due to the radial alignment of the polarization perpendicular to the limb. This definition is preferred to \autoref{eqn:radial_stokes} because we expect the polarization to be highest at the limbs for a Rayleigh-scattering solid body, as opposed to the azimuthally-aligned definition of $Q_\phi$ and $U_\phi$.

We show the radial Stokes $Q_r$ frames and Stokes $I$ frames in \autoref{fig:neptune_mosaic}. Similar to \citet{schmid_limb_2006} we see clear limb polarization in all filters with little polarization in the center of the image and the maximum polarization at the edge. We see roughly equal polarization along the whole limb (as opposed to concentration at the poles or equator). There is a spurious butterfly pattern in the F620 and F670 filters due to imperfect instrumental polarization calibration. This can be easily seen in the Stokes Q and U frames for this filter, which do not align with the \ang{0} and \ang{45} axes as expected. Future analysis with proper instrumental calibration is needed. The total intensity frames show some signs of a polar cloud along with some mild banding structures, especially in the F720 frame (disregarding any flat-field errors). This dataset represents significant improvements compared to \citet{schmid_limb_2006} due to improved angular resolution and sensitivity, pending polarimetric calibration.
