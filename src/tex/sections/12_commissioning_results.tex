\section{Commissioning Results}\label{sec:firstlight}

The VAMPIRES upgrades were tested on-sky from June to August 2023. Some results from the commissioning observations are presented below. During testing, many of the instrument configurations (polarimetry, coronagraphy, multiband imaging, narrowband imaging) were explored to verify that VAMPIRES is ready for observers.
