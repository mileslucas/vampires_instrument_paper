\section{Filters and Instrument Throughput}\label{sec:filters}

\subsection{Spectral Filters}
VAMPIRES has five \SI{50}{\nm} bandpass filters, four narrowband filters, an open broadband filter, and the dichroic filters in the multiband optic. All spectral filter transmission curves are compiled from manufacturer data and are shown in \autoref{fig:filters}. The filter characteristics and zero points are summarized in \autoref{tbl:filters}.

The Open filter is the widest and is constrained by the AO188 beamsplitter and the PyWFS pickoff. The multiband filters are defined by the consecutive transmissions/reflections through the stack of dichroics. The effective bandpasses are $\sim$\SI{50}{\nm} wide and have spectral leakage ($<$5\%) between some fields due to the imperfect dichroic transmissions. The narrowband filters come in pairs to enable differential imaging of the emission line and the local continuum. The H$\alpha$ filter is \SI{1}{\nm} wide and the H$\alpha$-continuum filter is \SI{2}{\nm} wide. The SII doublet and continuum filters are both \SI{3}{\nm} wide.

\subsection{Neutral Density Filters}

Two broadband reflective neutral density filters in the pupil mask wheel of VAMPIRES can be used to avoid saturating bright stars. Because these masks are in the pupil wheel, they cannot be used simultaneously with sparse aperture masks or Lyot stops. The optical density was measured for both filters: the ND10 has an optical density of \num{1.0}, and the ND25 has an optical density of \num{2.33}. The polarimetric effects of these filters have not been characterized and they are not recommended for use during polarimetric observations.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Beamsplitter Throughput}

VAMPIRES has two beamsplitters: a wire-grid polarizing beamsplitter cube (PBS) and a non-polarizing beamsplitter cube (NPBS). The beamsplitter throughput was measured in the Open filter and compared to the flux without a beamsplitter (\autoref{tbl:bs}). To avoid polarization biases, a linear polarizer was inserted after the internal source and rotated in steps of \ang{5} from \ang{0} to \ang{180}.

\subsection{Filter Color Corrections}

The filters in VAMPIRES do not follow any standard photometric system, although the Open filter is similar in central wavelength and width to the Johnson-Cousins R band \citep{bessell_ubvri_1979}. When using photometric values from online catalogs, the magnitudes must be converted from the source filter into the respective VAMPIRES filter, which depends on the spectrum of the observed star.

The Pickles stellar models \citep{pickles_stellar_1998} were used to measure the color correction for varying spectral types of main-sequence stars. For each model spectrum, \texttt{pysynphot} was used to calculate the color correction in Vega magnitude from Johnson-Cousins V, R, and Gaia G to the respective VAMPIRES filter (\autoref{fig:color_correction}). The Johnson V filter deviates up to \num{1} magnitude fainter than the VAMPIRES filters for later spectral types, the R filter has consistent colors compared to VAMPIRES except for the coolest stars, and the G filter can deviate up to \num{5} magnitudes brighter compared to VAMPIRES, depending on the spectral type.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Absolute Flux Calibration}

During commissioning, spectrophotometric standard stars HR 718 ($m_{\rm V}=$ \SI{4.273}) and HD 19445 ($m_{\rm V}=$ \SI{8.096}) were observed in each filter to calibrate the photometric zero points in \si{Jy} and \si{\electron/\second} \citep{hamuy_southern_1992,hamuy_southern_1994,stone_spectrophotometry_1996,zacharias_fourth_2013}.

The absolute flux calibration is summarized by the $C_{FD}$ coefficient, following \citet{gordon_james_2022}. This flux density conversion factor converts between instrument flux (in \si{\electron/\second}) and \si{Jy}. The instrument flux was measured using aperture photometry and corrected for atmospheric extinction using an empirical model from  \citet{buton_atmospheric_2013}. The conversion factors are derived from synthetic photometry of the calibrated stellar spectra.

The photometric zero points are mapped from Vega magnitudes to instrument flux in \si{\electron/\second} without a beamsplitter. The traditional zero point can be derived by incorporating each detector's beamsplitter throughput and camera gain rather than specifying all \num{280} unique combinations.

The zero points are used by taking the aperture flux in \si{\electron\per\second}, corrected for any beamsplitter or FLC throughputs, and converting to magnitudes with the zero point magnitude:
\begin{equation}
    m_{\rm filt}=\mathrm{ZP}_\mathrm{filt} - 2.5\log{\left(f\right)},
\end{equation}
or, equivalently, with the zero point flux
\begin{equation}
    m_{\rm filt}=-2.5\log{\left(f/f_\mathrm{ZP}\right)}.
\end{equation}
The surface brightness, $\Sigma_{\rm filt}$, can be calculated by dividing the calibrated flux by the area of a pixel ($\Omega_{px}=$\SI{3.5e-5}{arcsec^2/\pixel}). For Vega magnitudes, instead, use
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:surf_bright}
    \Sigma_{\rm filt} = m_{\rm filt} + 2.5\log{\left(\Omega_{px}\right)} = m_{\rm filt}- 11.1~\mathrm{mag/arcsec}^2.
\end{equation}

The accuracy of the zero points and conversion factors is constrained by atmospheric transmission variations along with dust accumulation and coating degradation of the telescope mirrors. Imaging a spectrophotometric standard at multiple elevation angles for observations demanding the highest photometric precision will give better accuracy.

\subsection{Limiting Magnitudes}

Under excellent conditions, the detector integration time and saturation limit set the brighter end of the magnitude range. The fastest detector integration time is \SI{7.2}{\micro\second} in ``fast'' mode and \SI{48}{\milli\second} in ``slow'' mode (for the standard imaging mode with a \ang{;;3}x\ang{;;3} FOV). For these calculations, the peak count limit is set to \SI{60000}{adu}, and it is assumed that the brightest pixel in the PSF will be 30\% the full aperture flux. The highest-throughput scenario (``Open'' filter, no beamsplitter, no FLC; \autoref{tbl:filters}) translates the limiting instrumental flux into $m_{\rm Open}$ = 2.1 in ``fast'' mode and $m_{\rm Open}$ = 11.7 in ``slow'' mode. The AO wavefront sensors constrain the faint observing limits: the current guider limits of AO188 are $m_{\rm R}$ $<$ 16 and the wavefront sensor limits for diffraction-limited imaging are rough $m_{\rm R}$ $<$ 12 \citep{minowa_performance_2010}.

The sky background above Maunakea at zenith (any lunar phase) is $\Sigma_{\rm R}=$\SI{17.9}{mag/arcsec^2} \citep{roth_measurements_2016}. Assuming, again, the highest-throughput observing configuration and using a pixel size of \SI{5.9}{mas}, this corresponds to an instrument flux of \SI{5e-2}{\electron/\pixel/\second}. This is an order of magnitude higher than the dark signal (\autoref{tbl:detectors}) and is the limiting noise term for exposures longer than \SI{1.2}{\second}.
