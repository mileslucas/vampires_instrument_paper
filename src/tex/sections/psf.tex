    \caption{Profiles of the six standard filter PSFs taken using the SCExAO internal source. (Top) radial profiles normalized to peak value. The passive speckles created by the DM actuator grid appear around \ang{;;0.8}. The edges of the control regions (or dark holes) are shown with vertical gray lines for the existing AO188 DM, the SCExAO DM, as well as the future AO3K DM. (Bottom) encircled energy normalized and cut off at \ang{;;1.1}.\label{fig:bench_profile}}
