\section{Photon number resolving statistics}\label{sec:pnr_derivation}

We derive the theoretical noise effects of photon-number resolving data \textit{post-hoc}, wherein data that is assumed to be perfectly bias-subtracted and flat-corrected is converted to electron flux using the detector gain and rounded to the nearest whole number.

Photons which enter the detector have a certain probability of becoming photo-electrons (hereafter electrons) described by the quantum efficiency. We ignore this for now and describe the input flux in electrons. These electrons are subject to counting statistics due to their Poisson nature. Let $H$ be the rate of electrons per pixel (the quanta exposure). The probability of measuring a signal of $k$ electrons is then
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{P}\left(k | H\right) = \frac{H^k e^{-H}}{k!}
\end{equation}

Now consider the Gaussian read noise, $\sigma_{RN}$
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{N}\left(x | k, \sigma_RN\right) = \frac{1}{\sigma_{RN}\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-(x - k)^2 / 2\sigma_{RN}^2}
\end{equation}
The probability of measuring $U$ electrons after both processes is the convolution of the two distributions
\begin{equation}
    P(U | H, \sigma_{RN}) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty{\mathcal{N}\left(U | k, \sigma_{RN}\right)\cdot \mathcal{P}\left(k|H\right)}
\end{equation}

Qualitatively, recognize that this can be described as discrete Poisson peaks convolved with a Gaussian of width $\sigma_{RN}$. Consider the simple case of $H=0$, the data is simply a Gaussian centered at zero. If this data is rounded to the nearest whole number, there is a small chance for values $|U|>0.5$  to get rounded to -1 and 1, respectively, or for $|U| > 1.5$ to -2 and 2, and so on, causing variance in the measured photon number. 

Consider a new distribution describing the probability of measuring values which will be rounded to the correct bins, $h(k)$

\begin{align}
    h(k) = &P\left(|U - k| < 0.5 | \sigma_{RN}\right) \\
    &= \int_{k - 0.5}^{k + 0.5}{\mathcal{N}(x | k, \sigma_{RN}) dx}
\end{align}

This can be rewritten using the cumulative distribution of the unit normal, $\Phi$, 
\begin{equation}
    h(k) = \Phi\left(\frac{k + 0.5}{\sigma_{RN}} \right) - \Phi\left(\frac{k - 0.5}{\sigma_{RN}} \right)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    \Phi(z) = \frac12 \left[1 - \mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \right]
\end{equation}
and where $\mathrm{erf}$ is the error function.

The expected value of this distribution is 0 by convenience of symmetry
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{E}[h] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}{ k \cdot h(k)} = 0
\end{equation}
and the variance of this distribution is
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:pnr_var}
    \mathrm{Var}[h] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}{ k^2\cdot h(k)}
\end{equation}
Therefore the total noise from photon number resolving is the combination of photon noise and \autoref{eqn:pnr_var}.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:pnr_std}
    \sigma = \sqrt{U + \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}{ k^2\cdot \left[\Phi\left(\frac{k + 0.5}{\sigma_{RN}} \right) - \Phi\left(\frac{k - 0.5}{\sigma_{RN}}\right)\right]}}
\end{equation}
For practical applications, $k$ is truncated to \num{\pm5} since the probability of observing a Gaussian event over 5 standard deviations away is extremely small, below $10^{-5}$, and therefore $k^2\approx0$.

In \autoref{fig:pnr} the relative improvement in S/N by photon number resolving (i.e., converting signal to electrons and rounding to nearest whole number) is shown. We also show the standard deviation of Monte Carlo samples ($N=10^4$) with and without rounding to confirm our theoretical results. Note that there are more sophisticated algorithms for achieving higher S/N ratios with photon-number resolving than simply rounding after the fact \citep{harpsoe_bayesian_2012}, but this is still a somewhat contrived use case for a ground-based instrument like VAMPIRES which will be photon-noise limited for most observations.
