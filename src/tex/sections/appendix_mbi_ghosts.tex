\section{Multiband Imaging Ghosts}\label{sec:ghosts}

When stacking dichroics with low angles of incidence extra reflections create ghost PSFs. Our multiband dichroic technique (\autoref{sec:mbi}) uses three dichroics in front of a mirror with $\sim$\ang{0.4} tilts between each filter with respect to the mirror. We characterized the ghost PSFs using a dispersing prism to understand their origin by analyzing spectra.

The incoming ray (red arrow) goes from left to right. The light reflected by D1 is shown with a green arrow. Light transmitted by D1 is blue-- the solid line is the main ray and the dashed line is the first ghost ray.\label{fig:mbi_ghost}}

To explain, consider the simple case of a single dichroic with a tilt ($\theta$) in front of a mirror (\autoref{fig:mbi_ghost}). There are three rays which explain the ghost behavior-- the first ray is the light which is reflected by the dichroic (green arrow), which will have an angle of $-2\theta$. The second ray is transmitted through the dichroic, reflects off the mirror, and returns back with an angle of \ang{0} (solid blue arrow). Because the dichroic has parallel faces there is no angular deviation of the transmitted rays; there will be a lateral translation but it is perfectly inverted when transmitted back through the medium. The angle between the solid blue arrow and green arrow ($2\theta$) is the characteristic separation between the fields in the focal plane.

The final ray is formed from a transmitted beam which reflects off the rear mirror and then reflects off the backside of the dichroic (dashed blue arrow). The reflection is a natural consequence of the dichroic filter curve-- any light which is not fully transmitted will be reflected by the dielectric coating and return back towards the mirror, picking up an angle of $2\theta$ due to the tilt of the dichroic. This beam reflects off the rear mirror again and then is transmitted through the dichroic with a ray angle of $2\theta$. This will form a PSF with the same spectrum as ``PSF 2'' but separated by an angle of $2\theta$. More back reflections can occur every time the light transmits through the dichroic, reflecting a small fraction of the light at integer multiple separations of $2\theta$ (i.e., $4\theta$, $6\theta$, and so on). These higher order ghosts are less of a concern because they are exponentially fainter and very far from the primary PSFs.

One way to remove these ghosts would be to improve the dielectric coatings of the filters until the ghosts are not detectable. Our multiband dichroics have a transmission of $\sim$95\% outside of the OD=$4$ blocking region, which means $\sim$5\% of light is reflected back into these ghosts, which is easily detected. It is difficult and expensive to manufacture dichroics which simultaneously have efficient blocking (OD$>$3) in band and high throughput out of band ($>$99.9\%), so we opted to address the ghosts geometrically-- creating a focal plane layout where no ghosts overlap with any science fields.

Our solution uses optimal angles for the dichroic tilts which places any ghost PSFs (and their \ang{;;3} FOV) completely out of the FOV of the primary fields (\autoref{fig:mbi_fields}). Our design uses as few pixel rows as possible to maximize detector readout speed. Additionally, we can crop out a single field to double the readout speed, still using three active fields. For our final design, we chose angles for each dichroic which were slightly larger than \ang{;;3} so that the manufacturing tolerances would allow for a minimum separation of $\sim$\SI{10}{\pixel} between fields.
