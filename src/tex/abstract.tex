    We present significant upgrades to the VAMPIRES instrument, a visible-light high-contrast imaging polarimeter integrated within SCExAO on the Subaru telescope. Key enhancements include new qCMOS detectors, advanced coronagraphs, and a multiband imaging mode, enabling improved sensitivity, resolution, and efficiency. These upgrades position VAMPIRES as a powerful tool for studying sub-stellar companions, forming protoplanets, circumstellar disks, stellar jets, and stellar mass-loss shells. The instrument achieves angular resolutions of $\sim$20 mas and Strehl ratios up to 60\%, with contrast limits between $10^{\text{-}4}$ to $10^{\text{-}6}$ from \ang{;;0.1} to $>$\ang{;;0.5}. We demonstrate these capabilities through spectro-polarimetric imaging of the HD 169142 circumstellar disk, high-contrast imaging of the sub-stellar companion HD 1160B, narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging of the R Aqr emission nebula, and spectro-polarimetric imaging of Neptune.
