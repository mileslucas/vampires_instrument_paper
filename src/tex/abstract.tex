\begin{abstract}
    We present significant upgrades to the VAMPIRES instrument, a visible-light (\SIrange{600}{800}{\nano\meter}) high-contrast imaging polarimeter integrated within SCExAO on the Subaru telescope. Key enhancements include new qCMOS detectors, coronagraphs, polarization optics, and a multiband imaging mode, improving sensitivity, resolution, and efficiency. These upgrades position VAMPIRES as a powerful tool for studying sub-stellar companions, accreting protoplanets, circumstellar disks, stellar jets, stellar mass-loss shells, and solar system objects. The instrument achieves angular resolutions from \SIrange{17}{21}{\mas} and Strehl ratios up to 60\%, with 5$\sigma$ contrast limits of $10^{\text{-}4}$ at \ang{;;0.1} to $10^{\text{-}6}$ beyond \ang{;;0.5}. We demonstrate these capabilities through spectro-polarimetric coronagraphic imaging of the HD 169142 circumstellar disk, ADI+SDI imaging of the sub-stellar companion HD 1160B, narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging of the R Aqr emission nebula, and spectro-polarimetric imaging of Neptune.
